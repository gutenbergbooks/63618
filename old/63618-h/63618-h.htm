    <div class="verse indent0">Her sights and sounds; dreams happy as her day;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And laughter learnt of friends; and gentleness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In hearts at peace, under an English heaven.”</div>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">A little</span> chronicle of a great time may have an
interest of its own quite incommensurate from
its intrinsic worth. These pages do not pretend
to any merit beyond faithfulness; but they are
the true record of the everyday life of an average
family during the first year of the war of wars;
what we have felt, what we have seen; the
great anxieties; the trivial incidents and emotions
which have been shared by thousands of
our fellow-countrymen. This home has been so
far exceptional that it has had few hostages to
give to fortune, and that it has mercifully been
spared the supreme sacrifice demanded with
such tragic universality, and given with such a
glorious resignation: but, infinitesimal pulse, it
has beaten with the great arteries, the whole
mighty heart of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Annals enough there are, and will be, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[Pg viii]</span>
soul-stirring events of 1914: the proud rise of
the nation, its struggles, its failures, its appalling
blunders, and the super-heroism that has saved
the consequences. If Armageddon be not the
end of the world; if there be generations coming
after to carry the sheaves of that seed sown with
blood and tears to-day, there will be no dearth
of evidence to enable our children’s children to
feed upon the story of England’s glory. They
will be able to read and learn and look back, out
of the peace won for them, to examples almost
beyond the conception of idealism. Should, by
some freak of chance, this humble book survive,
it may not then be without an interest of its own.</p>

<p>This was how the quiet stay-at-home family
felt and thought in the days of the titanic
conflict; these were the little things that happened
in a little country house. No great moral
lesson certainly, no revelation of out-of-the-way
philosophy; just the way we hoped and feared;
the way we still laughed and talked, gardened
and worked, the way we were led on from day
to day and made to find, after all, what seemed
unbearable, bearable, brought to see light where
there was apparently no issue.</p>

<p>Being, as we say&mdash;so far&mdash;singularly un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[Pg ix]</span>stricken
in the midst of so much mourning, we
have been able to enjoy the lighter side of
existence, the humours, the quaintnesses, which
relieve, blessedly for poor humanity, the most
complicated and the most desperate situations.
Perhaps, therefore, these random jottings,
turned, many of them, to the lighter side of
life, may, in some stray hour of relaxation,
amuse here and there one actively engaged in
the stern actions which the time demands.
Perhaps the breath of the garden may be
grateful to a mind upon which the wind from
the trenches has blown so long.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of laughter about our
country, even now. The troops go singing
down the roads in the early dawn, and come
tramping back to camp, with tired feet, but with
joking tongues, after the long days. We know
there is much laughter in the fighting-line;
innocent, childish pleasantries, catchwords that
run with grins from lip to lip. There is no
laughter so genuine as that which springs from
a good conscience. And so there is laughter in
the hospitals also, thank God!</p>

<p>We trust our pages may add a little mirth
more to the gallant spirit abroad; beguile the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[Pg x]</span>
fancy of one wounded man, or the oppression of
one anxious heart. Then, indeed, they will not
have been written in vain.</p>

<p>Would only that through them we could
convey an impression of the surroundings in
which we write; would we could bring our
readers the atmosphere of these Surrey heights;
of the rolling moorland, of the winds, sweet with
heather, aromatic with the pine-woods, charged
with the garden scents that blow about us; then
truly would they find refreshment! Would we
could show them our terraced borders where
now the roses are breaking into wonderful
bloom, pink, crimson, cream, fire-carmine, and
yellow; where the delphiniums are arrayed,
noble phalanxes in every shade of enamel blue
and purple&mdash;spires marshalled together like
some fantastic cathedral town, viewed in impossible
moonlight, out of a Doré dream; where
the canterbury bells are beginning to shake out
their cups, tinted like the colours in a child’s
paint-box; and the campanulas, with their tones
of mountain wildness&mdash;of snow and blue distance&mdash;bring
coolness into the hotter tints of the
border.</p>

<p>We look down on this July richness from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[Pg xi]</span>
small white house with its green blinds, which,
though compact, round-windowed, comfortably
Georgian, has yet an absurd Italian look.</p>

<p>On the upper terrace wall the ornamental
pots, each with its little golden cypress, begin
to foam with lobelia and creeping geranium;
between two clumps of cypress-trees, Verocchio’s
little smiling boy grips his fish against a tangle
of blush rambler. And that’s a bit of Italy for
you, even with the ultimate vision of wild moor!</p>

<p>The terraces run down the hill, tier below
tier. On the other side of the valley the woods
rise between the shouldering heather-clad hills,
to the east; the wide, long view spreads to the
south-west, where the hills begin to lift again,
and distant pine-woods march across the sky.</p>

<p>Would we could but give to mere words the
sense of altitude, of great horizons which our
high-perched position gives us!</p>

<p>“You’re in a kind of eyrie,” says one visitor.
And another: “Oh, I do like all this sky! It’s
so seldom one really gets the sky about one.”</p>

<p>“You have,” said an exile&mdash;an old Belgian
religious&mdash;after tottering solemnly along the
terrace walk, “you have here an earthly paradise.
A spot God has wonderfully blessed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[Pg xii]</span></p>

<p>Besides the startling contrasts and the fairness
of its prospect, the little place has a special
charm of its own, which is not possible to
describe, yet which everyone feels who comes
within its precincts. We quite wait for the
phrase now, upon the lips of guests under the
red-tiled roof: “It’s so extraordinarily peaceful.”</p>

<p>Peace! Peace in the midst of the boom of the
war tocsin, echoing all round! Peace, in spite
of the newspapers, the letters, the rumours, the
perpetual coming and going of troops, the
distant reverberations of gun practice, the never-relaxing
grip of apprehension! Yes, in spite of
all the world being at war&mdash;there is peace in the
Villino.</p>

<p>Some of us believe it wells out from a little
chamber, where, before the golden shrine, the
Donatello angels hold up never-extinguished
lamps. Or a visitor may say wonderingly: “I
think it must be because you’re all so united.”
Or, perhaps, as the old monk had it, there is an
emanation from the place itself: so beautiful a
spot of God’s earth, so high up, so apart between
the moor and the valley! Whatever the reason,
we wish that some of the peace that lingers here
may reach out from these pages, and touch with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[Pg xiii]</span>
serenity any unquiet heart or restless spirit that
comes their way.</p>

<p>And since the soldiers we have written about
wanted toys, like sick children, their mascot to
hug&mdash;here comes a procession of our little fur
folk walking vividly before your mental eye.</p>

<p>Here is Loki, the first and oldest of the pets.
Loki, growing grey about the muzzle, elderly
already by reason of his six years of life; with
his immense coat, tawny, tufted, plumed, fringed;
with his consequential gait; his “quangley”
ways: so easily offended, in his own strong
sense of dignity; with his over-loving heart;
his half-human, half-lion eyes; Loki, with his
clockwork regularity of habit; his disdainful
oblivion, except on certain rare occasions, of the
smaller fur fry; Loki, making windmill paws to
the Master of the Villino, till he has succeeded
in dragging him away from his pipe and his
arm-chair for a walk on the moors; or yet frantically
and mutely imploring the mystified visitor
to go away and cease from boring him.</p>

<p>And here is Mimosa, the most Chinese of
little ladies, hued like a ripe chestnut, with dark
orbs so immense and protuberant as almost to
seem to justify the legend that Pekinese will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[Pg xiv]</span>
drop their eyes about if you don’t take care.
Very sleek and sinuous and small is she, a
creature of moods and freaks, fastidious to the
point of never accepting a meal with the other
dogs; with all kinds of tricksy, pretty ways of
play, shrilly barking and dancing for bread pills,
which she will fling in the air and catch again,
throw over her shoulder and waltz round to
pounce upon, more like a kitten than a little dog.</p>

<p>And the puppy, Loki’s own contemned daughter,
the colour of a young lion cub&mdash;the puppy,
with her irrepressible enthusiasms, her unsnubbable
demonstrations, her “pretty paws,” her
coal-black muzzle, her innocent countenance&mdash;“Plain
Eliza”&mdash;whose heart, like her father’s, is
so much too big and tender and faithful, that
happening the other day to see, over the garden
hedge, a member of the family in whose house
she was born, she rent the air with such shrieks
of ecstasy that the whole Villino establishment
rushed to the spot, thinking she was being
murdered.</p>

<p>Then there is Arabella, the lavrock setter.
“Perverse, precise, unseasonable Pamela,” cries
Mr. B. in Richardson’s celebrated novel, when
having pursued the virtuous damsel to her last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[Pg xv]</span>
refuge, she not unnaturally misunderstands the
purport of his next advance.</p>

<p>When she does understand she exclaims:
“Mr. B. is the noblest of men, he has offered me
marriage.”</p>

<p>To come back to Arabella. We wish we could
find a union of epithets as telling as that of
Mr. B. in the exasperation of his conscious
rectitude. Inane, inert, inconvenient Arabella,
fairly well describes our sentiments towards her.
She is a bore and a burden. She feels the heat
and goes out and takes mud-baths, and comes in
and shakes herself in the drawing-room. She
cannot understand why she should not lie in our
laps as well as the puppies. She howls mournfully
outside the kitchen door unless she is
invited in to assist in the cooking. She has
destroyed three arm-chair covers in the servants’
hall, preferring that resting-place to her basket.
“Fond” is the word that might best be used to
qualify our feelings towards her. We don’t
know what to do with her, but we should not
like to be without her.</p>

<p>Then there is the black Persian, “Bunny,” our
kind dead Adam’s cat. You will meet him
circling round the garden. He will raise his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[Pg xvi]</span>
huge bushy tail when he sees you, and fix his
inscrutable amber eyes upon you, questioningly.
Then he will pass on with a soundless mew.
He is looking for his master, and you can watch
him slink away, superb, stealthy, pursuing his
fruitless quest.</p>

<p>The fur children come first, being the Villino’s
own family, but there are other kinds with us
now. The little Belgians run about the paths
calling to each other with their quaint pattering
intonation, so that long before you hear the
words you know by the sound of the voices
coming up the hill that these are the small exiles.
Brown-haired Marthe, with her childish ways
and her serious mind, her ripe southern-tinted
face, and Philippe, with his shock of fine hair,
hazel-colour, cut medieval fashion, and his little
throat, which bears his odd picturesque head as
a flower-stem its bloom. And sturdy Viviane,
stumping up with her solemn air, precisely
naming the flowers as she comes:</p>

<p>“Sweet Will-li-yam! Del-phi-ni-um! Canterry
bells!”</p>

<p>Soon Thierry, the schoolboy, will be here
too. The garden is full of Easter holiday
memories of him; a little perspiring boy, squar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[Pg xvii]</span>ing
a tree-trunk with boxing-gloves five times too
large for him, under the grand-paternal tuition
of the Master of the Villino. It would have been
difficult to say who was the more pleased, child
or man. And Thierry can box with a right good
will; a very excellent little boy this, with a
bursting patriot’s heart under his shy, reserved
ways. No doubt he fancied he was hitting a
German with each of those well-directed blows.</p>

<p>It is nice to have the children about the Villino;
and that they are exiles adds pathos to the sound
of their happy laughter in our ears, and a tenderness
to the pleasure with which our eyes watch
their unconscious gaiety.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, if anyone wanted to have a
really poetic impression of our little house, they
should see it by moonlight, or&mdash;which, of course,
nobody does except by accident&mdash;in the summer
dawn. Whether it is because of an unconscious
appreciation of the limits of our own intellect, or
whether from some inherent vulgarity, human
nature is prone to depreciate all that is laid out
very plainly before it. We demand mystery in
everything if it is to mean beauty to us.</p>

<p>Some such idea as this Mr. Bernard Shaw
expresses&mdash;in one of his uncanny leaps of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[Pg xviii]</span>
spirit out of his own destructive philosophy&mdash;when
he makes the Christian martyr retort to
the Pagan who accuses her of not understanding
her God: “He wouldn’t be my God if I could!”</p>

<p>To pass from the infinite to the atom: when
the Villino garden and its prospects are but
imperfectly revealed on a moonlight night the
view, with mystery added to its fairness, becomes
wonderful in its loveliness.</p>

<p>On such a night as this the valley holds mist
in its bosom, and the distant moor ridges in
their pine-woods might be the Alps, for the air
of distance they assume, the remote dignity
with which they withdraw themselves, pale and
ethereal, into the serene sky. It may be the
moon is rising over the great wooded hill in
front of the Villino. The white radiance pours
full upon us. We know all that is revealed, and
yet all is different. Each familiar object has a
strange and transfigured face. The little cypress-trees,
rimmed in silver, cast black shadows on
the grass, silver-cobwebbed. The great moors
are exquisite ghost wildernesses, their hollows
full of cloudy secrets. And you can hear the
night-jar spinning out its monotonous, mysterious
song, a song which does not break the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[Pg xix]</span>
grand restfulness, but only accompanies it. We
have no running streams&mdash;there is nothing
perfect here below, it is a great want! But the
song of the night-jar makes up a little for the
voice of water in the night-time. It is the hearing
of some such sound, lost in the turmoil of
day, that emphasizes the incomparable silence.</p>

<p>Our heights in the sunrise show once again
a world transfigured; a sparkling, coloured,
other-worldly world.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The saffrons and yellows begin to gather over
the moors, and the crests of the hills and the
tree-tops are tipped with light. Each flower has
its shimmering aureole; each has taken a hue
never seen in the garish fulness of the sunshine,
enamel, stained-glass-window hues, difficult to
describe. There is a curious look of life about
everything. It is the exquisite hour of the
earth, untroubled by man; garden and woods,
hill and valley, unfold their secrets to the sky
and hold commune with the dawn-angels. There
is a freshness, a vividness, almost a surprise
about the world, as if all things were made new
again. An immense difference in the scene<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[Pg xx]</span>
compared to the night’s grave mysteries. The
latter is a canto from the Divine Comedy as
against Fra Angelico’s dance of Paradise. And
to this innocent joy of the waking earth you
have the songs of the birds. Some ecstatic
thrush, or liquid slow-chanting blackbird, will
have begun the hymns at the first glimmer
of dawn, and hold the world spell-bound till the
lesser chorus spreads a tangled web of sound
from end to end of the valley and the garden
heights, and the moor silence is reached.</p>

<p>Morning after morning of this glorious summer
of the war, the pageant of sunrise marches, for
those who have eyes to see, and night after
night the mystery gathers in the moonlight.
All England holds some such fair visions. Does
it not seem a dream that it should be so? The
horror, the devastation, the noise, the fire, the
bloodshed, the agony, the struggle, only a couple
of hundred miles away, are they the only realities
in this red year? To us in England’s heart,
still mercifully unwounded, these sometimes
seem the dream, the dream of evil, and our
peace the reality.</p>

<p>Dream, or reality, it is our peace we want to
bring to you.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> most usual remark that people make after
a visit to our little house on the hill is this:
“How peaceful!”</p>

<p>Even in the ordinary course of life&mdash;those
times that now seem extraordinary to a world
already accustomed to the universal struggle&mdash;when
everyone in England was in peace, except
where their own unquiet spirits may have
marred it, even then this nest of ours seemed
peace within peace. We do not know now
whether the contrast is not the more acute.
One of the thousands of homes dedicated to
the quiet joys and innocencies of life, where no
one ever wanted to quarrel, because all found
the hours so full of sweet content, we do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[Pg 2]</span>
flatter ourselves that we are singular: only
typical. The shadow of the great cloud cast
at first a hideous, unnatural darkness over our
harmless ways.</p>

<p>All during the long golden summer, when
we looked out across the moor basking in the
radiance; when our roses bloomed and the
garden rioted in colour, and the valley slowly
turned from green to russet; when the harvest-moon
went up like a huge brass platter in
silver skies, the very beauty of it all clutched
one’s heart the fiercer. How fares it with our
boys over there in the heat and the stress?
How much worse it must be for them that the
sun should blaze upon them, marching, firing,
rushing forward, lying wounded, wanting
water!... Oh, dear lads of England, how we
at home agonized with you!</p>

<p>The little house, bought in a light-hearted
hour, furnished with infinite zest in happy
days out of distant Rome, was a sort of toy
to us from the beginning; and kind friends
surveyed it with indulgent and amused, yet
admiring, glances, such as one would bestow
upon an ingenious and pretty plaything. We
called it the Villino, partly in memory of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span>
Italian sojourn, and partly because, though it
is bounded by wild moors, it contrives a
quaintly Italianate air. It stands boldly on
the lip of the hill, and the garden runs down
in terraces to a deep valley. Across the valley
to the east the moors roll, curve upon curve.
South, facing us, the trees begin their march;
and westward the valley spreads, rising into
moors again, where again the fir-trees sentinel
the sky. The view from the terrace rather
takes your breath away. It is unexpected and
odd, and unlike anything, except Italy and
Scotland mixed: the wildness, and the trim
terraced garden with its calculated groups of
cypress, its vases brimming with flowers, its
stone steps, its secret bowery corners.</p>

<p>“Mount Ecstasy” an artist friend has dubbed
it. “Is it possible,” she asked us in the middle
of this radiant October of the war, “that the
wind ever blows here? Do you ever hear it
shrieking round the house?”</p>

<p>We gave her a vivid description of what the
wind could do when it liked; when it came up
the valley with the rain on its wings. She
looked incredulous.</p>

<p>“Is it possible?” she repeated softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>She had come straight from the great camp
at Lyndhurst, where the 7th Division, gallant
as ill-fated, had gathered in all its lusty strength
before embarking for the bloody struggle in
Flanders. She had just said good-bye to her
eldest son; the call of the bugle, the march
of thousands in unison, was in her ears; the
vision of the crowded transport vivid in her
mind. Yet here she would not believe that
even the winds could break our peace.</p>

<p>This was very much what we felt ourselves
when the Storm burst; it was incredible with
this placidity all about us.</p>

<p>One tries to think what it would be had the
Villino sprung to life in Belgian soil, or did the
Hun succeed in landing, and come pouring, a
noxious tide, across our country roads, taking
the poor little place on its way. The first
refugee from that heroic and devastated land
who found shelter here was very smiling and
brave until she came out into the garden.
Then she began to cry.</p>

<p>“I had such pretty flowers too.”</p>

<p>All our moors are turning into camps; they
grew like mushrooms in a day, it seems. We
hear the soldiers marching by in the dead of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[Pg 5]</span>
the night, singing, poor boys! to give themselves
heart&mdash;such nights, too, as they are this
autumn, deluged with rain and blown through
with relentless wind! We stand between two
hospitals; and Belgian refugees overflow in
the villages. We read of the bombardment
of the coast and the dropping of bombs, and
yet we do not realize. We still feel as in a
nightmare from which we must wake up.</p>

<p>Yet the effects of war are beginning to
stamp themselves, even in the Villino and in
its garden. We are, some of us, naturally
inclined to luxuries. The mistress of the
Villino is certainly a spendthrift where bulbs
and tubers and seeds are concerned; and for
three out of the four years since she owned
the little property, the spring garden has justified
impenitence. Oh! the crocuses running
through the grass of that third terrace called
the Hemicycle! Oh! the scyllas making miniature
skies under the almond-trees! Oh! the
tulips swaying jewel chalices over the mists of
blue forget-me-not: glories of the past, this
coming spring, how shall the garden miss you!</p>

<p>It must be explained that our soil&mdash;green-sand&mdash;our
position&mdash;high-perched&mdash;our general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
tendency&mdash;sloping down-hill&mdash;make us charmingly
dry and healthy, but disagree with the
bulb. It is impossible to naturalize anything less
hardy than the daffodil. The snowdrop declines
to live with us. Therefore our autumn bulb
lists were copious and varied, and the results
ephemeral and lovely. This year there has
been no bulb list; who could think of this
completely personal and selfish gratification
when it is the flower of our manhood that is
being mown down out yonder? when all that
can be spared must be spared to help! There
is so little one can do, and so appallingly much
to be done.</p>

<p>And inside, too, we are being pinched; not
badly, not cruelly, but just as if the war monster
had reached out one of its myriad hands&mdash;quite
a small and rather weak one&mdash;and had hold of
us, enough to nip, not to strangle.</p>

<p>It will not surprise any garden owner to
learn that this is the year of all others in which
Adam, the Villino gardener, had an “accident”
with the cuttings, and that therefore those
bushes of chrysanthemums, which look so well
on our grey and orange landings, have not
been forthcoming. Another year it would not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>
have mattered. We should have gaily replenished
the Italian pots from the local nursery,
where chrysanthemums are a speciality.
But as it is&mdash;we go without.</p>

<p>In a hundred other items the nipping fingers
produce the same paralyzing result. The
footman, who, we regret to say, gibbered at
the thought of enlisting, and avowed to a horrified
kitchen circle that he might perhaps be
able to help to carry a wounded man, but face
a bullet&mdash;“Never, never!”&mdash;found his post untenable
in a household chiefly composed of the
fair and patriotic sex. We conceived that the
times demanded of us to bring the garden-boy
into the house, thus reducing our establishment
without inflicting hardship.</p>

<p>Such, however, was not the opinion of
Juvenal, our eccentric butler. This strange
being, from certain aspects of his character,
might have been, as the Italian prelate said of
a distinguished Jesuit preacher, “born in a
volcano.” He is devoted to the dogs, and has
a genius for settling flowers; and he has become
altogether so much a part of the establishment&mdash;the
<i>famiglia</i>&mdash;that the Villino would lose
half its charm without him. Nevertheless, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
is volcanic! And though at first he took the
substitution of four-foot in buttons for six-foot
in livery with an angelic resignation, Vesuvius
broke forth with unparalleled vigour and frequency
after a couple of weeks of the regimen.
Unfortunately, Juvenal is not sustained by
patriotic ardour. He deliberately avoids afflicting
himself with thoughts about the war. “I
never could bear, miss, to see anything that
was hurt! And as for anything dying, miss,
even if it was only a little animal&mdash;why, there, I
couldn’t as much as look at my poor old father!”
Here is his point of view as expressed tersely
to the Signorina of the Villino.</p>

<p>This being the case, he succeeds so thoroughly
in blocking his mind against all facts connected
with war time (except the entertaining of “a
nice young fellow from the camp”) that he has
found himself injured to the core by our attempts
at economy. And when it came to our
unexpectedly inviting a refugee lady into his
dining-room, and his having to lay three extra
places for her and her children, the lava overflowed
into the upper regions. We with difficulty
extricated “Miss Marie” from the burning
flood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>We are all slightly overwrought these days,
and instead of pretending not to notice, which
is the only possible way where Juvenal is concerned,
we suggested that he should look for
another situation. It would be difficult to say
whether outraged feeling or amazement predominated
in him. Of course, we all deeply
repented our hasty action, and then ensued
four uncomfortable weeks of cross purposes in
which neither side would “give in.” Finally
the poor volcano departed in floods of tears,
with twenty-four bird-cages and a Highland
terrier.</p>

<p>“Don’t you take on, Mr. Juvenal,” said Mrs.
MacComfort, the cook; “you’ll be back in no
time!”</p>

<p>There ensued a dreadful interlude with an
anæmic young butler unfit for military service,
who promptly developed toothache and a
bilious attack, and whom all the servants regarded
as a spy for the convincing reasons that
he sat and rolled his eyes and said nothing.</p>

<p>He was, however, non-volcanic, and placidly
accepted Jimmy, the promoted garden-boy.
This was not reciprocal, for Jimmy, who displayed
a degree of conscientiousness, peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
indeed in the light of after-events, could not
reconcile himself to the change.</p>

<p>He would canter heavily, smothered to the
chin in six-foot’s pantry apron, into the drawing-room
to announce with a burst of tears to the
young housekeeper:</p>

<p>“Please, miss, ’e won’t suit! ’E won’t do
nuthin’ I tell him! Oh, please, miss, he’s putting
the cups&mdash;the mistress’s own cup&mdash;in the wrong
cupboard, and”&mdash;with a howl&mdash;“he ain’t washed
it, miss! And when I tell him, ’e says it doesn’t
matter!”</p>

<p>We didn’t think he would suit, ourselves.
We had all said so often that Juvenal was perfectly
dreadful, and couldn’t be endured another
minute, and every member of the <i>famiglia</i> had
so frequently declared with tears that if Mr.
Juvenal remained she could not possibly stay;
she had borne it as long as she could, not to
make unpleasantness, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>We were unanimous now in regrets.</p>

<p>“God be with poor Juvenal!” said Mrs. MacComfort,
the dear, soft-spoken Irish cook; and
added darkly: She wouldn’t like to be saying
what she thought of the new butler.</p>

<p>However, <i>à quelque chose malheur est bon</i>, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
had the following incident taken place under
Juvenal’s dog-loving eye, as Juvenal himself
subsequently remarked, there would certainly
have been murder done. We ourselves had
been inclined to consider Jimmy an agreeable
member of the domestic circle. Nobody minded
telling him to take out the dogs, no matter how
bad the weather was, and Jimmy always responded
with that smile of cheerful alacrity
that so endeared him.</p>

<p>The tale which is here narrated may seem
irrelevant to the share which the Villino has
had to take in the universal and terrible cataclysm,
but nevertheless the incidents therein
set forth directly issued from it; and, in spite of
a dash of comedy, they were tragic enough for
those chiefly concerned, namely, the youngest
“fur-child” and Jimmy himself. If we had not
taken Jimmy into the house, Jimmy would not
have been told to walk the dogs; and if Jimmy
had not walked the dogs, the singular drama
of the phantom dog-stealers and the baby
Pekinese would never have occurred.</p>

<p>There were then three fur-children: Arabella,
the Lavroch setter&mdash;lovely, dull, early Victorian,
worthy creature; Loki, the beloved, chief of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
the little dumb family, first in our affections&mdash;a
quaint, saturnine, very Chinese little gentleman,
with crusty and disconcerting ways, and
almost a human heart; and Mimi, the heroine
of this adventure&mdash;Mimosa on solemn occasions&mdash;really
a beauty, with all the engaging Pekinese
oddities and that individuality of character
which each one seems to possess; spoilt, imperious,
vivid!</p>

<p>It was a very wet day, and Jimmy had been
ordered to don his master’s mackintosh cape
and take the fur-children up the moor. The
first peculiar incident was that Mimi ran three
times headlong from his guardianship. As fast
as she was coaxed down one stairs she was up
the other, with her tail between her legs. It
might have made us pause, but it didn’t. We
said: “Poor Mimi doesn’t like getting her feet
wet.” Anyone who had heard the boy cooing
to his charges in tones of the most dulcet affection
would have been as dense as we were.</p>

<p>That evening the dark adventure took place.
Jimmy came running into the kitchen, more
incredibly mud-encrusted than any living
creature outside an alligator is ever likely to
be again; and, bursting into loud wails, declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
that he had been set upon by two men and
robbed of Mimi.</p>

<p>“Run, run,” cried Mrs. MacComfort, “and
tell the master!”</p>

<p>Jimmy ran, working himself up as he went,
so that it was what our Irish nurse used to call
“roaring and bawling” that he rushed into the
library and poured out his dreadful news. The
master dashed in pursuit of the miscreants, led
by the hero, who cantered him uphill a good
half-mile. He was followed by the cook and
her Cinderella, valiantly brandishing sticks.
Having reached the post-office, the chase was
given up, and the master of the Villino was
returning dejectedly when a yapping behind
the hedge that skirted the road was recognized
by Mrs. MacComfort as unmistakably Mimi’s
voice.</p>

<p>Mimi was extracted, none the worse for her
emotions, but with the remnants of a torn
pocket-handkerchief tied round her neck.</p>

<p>Whether it was the abnormal layers of mud
on Jimmy’s countenance; or the curious fact
that, in spite of the horrible treatment which
he vowed had been inflicted upon him in a
hand-to-hand struggle with two men, under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
mud there was not a scratch upon his ingenious
countenance; or whether it was that, although
the conflict was supposed to have taken place
within our own courtyard, no sound reached
anyone in the house&mdash;there and then Jimmy’s
master came to this conclusion: “I believe he’s
made it all up.” But he didn’t say so. The
boy was only cross-examined.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you shout?” asked Mrs.
MacComfort.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t. They stuffed something soft
into my throat&mdash;a handkerchief, I think it was.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get all that mud?” asked
the gardener next morning. “You never
picked that up in here. You couldn’t, not if
you’d scraped the ground.”</p>

<p>It was then that Jimmy discovered that the
assault had taken place outside the gates.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s mistress questioned him next, and
she instantly saw that he was lying. To point
the moral and adorn the tale she sent for the
policeman.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you ’oller?” said the policeman.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s knees shook together.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t ’oller,” he maintained doggedly.
“They’d stuffed something down me throat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” said the policeman. “Maybe
it was this ’ankercher, was it?”</p>

<p>He produced a dreadful rag that had been
picked up on the road. It fitted neatly with
the other rag that had been round Mimi’s neck:
awful <i>pièces de conviction</i>!</p>

<p>“I say it’s your ankercher. Don’t go for to
deny it. I say it’s your ankercher; I ’appen to
know it’s your ankercher. I say you did it all
yerself!”</p>

<p>When a six-foot, black-moustached policeman,
with boring eye, rolls out such an accusation
in tremendous crescendo, what can a little
criminal do but collapse? Jimmy collapsed.
It was his ankercher. He ’ad done it. There
never ’ad been no men. He never ’ad been
knocked down. He ’ad rolled in the mud on
purpose, in the ditch where it was thickest.
He ’ad tried to ’urt Mimi.</p>

<p>“Why?&mdash;why?&mdash;why?”</p>

<p>Even our local Sherlock Holmes couldn’t
extract anything like a plausible reason. Loki’s
mistress had to piece one together for herself.</p>

<p>Jimmy hadn’t liked taking the dogs out on a
wet day. He had therefore planned to strangle
Mimi and throw her over the hedge, believing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
that if he showed himself unable to protect the
dogs he would not be sent out with them any
more.</p>

<p>The two immediate results of this event,
extraordinary indeed in the annals of the
Villino, where a St. Francis-like love of our
little fur and feather brothers and sisters
dominates, was the prompt restoration of
Jimmy to the arms of Mrs. Mutton, his washerwoman
mamma, and the summoning of Juvenal
to the telephone. He was staying with his
brother, a postmaster. We communicated the
awful attempt. Juvenal averred, on the other
side of the wire, that you could have knocked
him down with a feather. Having thus re-established
communications, we wrote, and,
tactfully cloaking our own undignified yearnings
with the innocence of the fur-children, we
told him that the dogs missed him very much.
He was swift to seize the “paw of friendship,”
and, following our artful lead, responded by
return of post that Betty had been “that
fretted,” he did not know what to do with her&mdash;“<i>wine</i>
she did from morning till night!”</p>

<p>It was obvious that anyone with a grain of
decent feeling must instantly remedy such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
state of affairs. Juvenal returned with the
twenty-four bird-cages and Betty the terrier.</p>

<p>We have compounded with an assistant
parlourmaid; it is by no means an economy,
but four-foot in buttons is in such demand that
Jimmy is irreplaceable.</p>

<p>After all, so little has that war-pinch nipped
us, that, if it was not to laugh at them, one
would be ashamed to set these infinitesimal
bruises down at all. And, thank God! now one
can laugh a little again; the days are gone by
when it seemed as if every small natural joy
had been squeezed out of life, that existence
itself was one long nightmare of apprehension.</p>

<p>We do not yet know what the future may
have in store for us; but, pray heaven, those
mornings may never dawn again when one
could scarcely open the paper for the beating
of one’s heart.</p>

<p>It is not, we hope, that we are accustomed to
agony, though no doubt there is something of
habit that takes the edge off suspense and grief.
We are also better prepared; we have got, as
it were, into our second wind, and we are, after
our English fashion, perhaps even a little more
determined than we were to start with. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
it all began, with what seemed merely an insensate
crime in a half-civilized country, no one
would have thought that England, much less
our little house, would be affected. Though,
indeed, personally, the murder of the Archduchess
touched the mistress of the Villino a
little more nearly than most, for as children
they had played together. It was, and is, a
very vivid memory.</p>

<p>She and her sisters had been brought to
Brussels for their education, and Sophie was
one of the youngest, if not the last, in the
nursery of the Austro-Hungarian Legation in
that city. The Chotek family used to come
to the <i>parc</i>; a tribe of quaint, fair-haired
children. They wore short black velvet coats
and caps, and plaid skirts, rather long. The
Signora can see little Sophie before her now;
a Botticelli angel, with an aureole of fair curls,
silver-gold, standing out all round her small,
pale, delicate face; a serious child, with lustrous
eyes and immense black lashes, and a fine,
curling mouth. She thought her lovely and
longed to cuddle her, with the maternal instinct
early developed.</p>

<p>“Have you much sister?” said the tiny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
Austrian, addressing her English friend upon
their introduction with great solemnity.</p>

<p>Who could have thought what a destiny lay
before her, and in what a supreme act of self-devotion
the soul, already luminous in that
frail, exquisite little envelope, was to pass
away? We have been told on some excellent
authority that she was not popular in her
anomalous position, at least in her own class.
But her singular romance nevertheless was
crowned by so true a married happiness that
it can leave one in no doubt that she was
worthy of the sacrifice made for her by the
Imperial heir. He was&mdash;it is no uncharity to
mention so well-known a fact&mdash;a man of bad
life; she was his mother’s lady-in-waiting,
appointed to that post because of destitution,
no longer in the first freshness of her youth,
supposed to be a person of small significance&mdash;one
of those colourless shadows that haunt the
chairs of the great. But she captivated the
most important Prince in her country, barring
the Emperor; and, what is more, her spell never
lost its power. To that last breath, which,
greatly favoured in their awful tragedy, they
drew together, they adored each other. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
made of him a model husband, a model father,
a man of rectitude and earnestness. They had
children, and these were all their joy. It was
one of the reproaches cast upon her by the
indignant royalties of the Vienna Court that
the Duchess of Hohenberg was so economical
she would go down to her kitchen and see the
things given out. If she wanted to save money,
it was for those children, cut off from their
natural inheritance by the cast-iron laws that
debarred their mother from a share in her
husband’s rank.</p>

<p>An invited guest at the wedding of the present
young hereditary Archduke to the Princess Zita
has given us a description of an incident which
well illustrates the treatment which the non-royal
wife of the Heir Apparent received at the
hands of her royal relatives. When the Duchess
of Hohenberg entered, her long, narrow train
caught in some projecting obstacle as she
swept up the little chapel. The place was full
of Archdukes and Archduchesses, in their
wedding attire. Not one of these high-born
beings budged. Each looked straight at the
altar, absorbed in pious prayer. The ostracized
lady had to disengage herself as best she could,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
and advance, blushing hotly, to her appointed
place, unescorted. A few minutes after a
belated Archduchess, entering swiftly, met
with the same mishap. Instantly she was
surrounded with politely assisting Hoheiten.</p>

<p>The friend to whom we owe the anecdote remarked
that it had been “a dreadful moment,”
and that one could not help feeling sorry for the
poor Duchess. But it is to be remarked that
she herself&mdash;delightful, cultivated, large-minded
creature though she was&mdash;had been among the
stony ones, and there had even been a glint
of pleasure in her eyes under the compassion
as she told the story.</p>

<p>Sophie was of those who are hated; but,
after all, what did it matter? Was she not
loved?</p>

<p>Our daughter’s Hungarian godmother&mdash;a
most fairy and entrancing lady, with all the
spirit of her race under the appearance of a
French Marquise&mdash;like most Magyars, championed
the cause of one whom they intended
to make their future Queen. She gave us a
pretty account of the great pleasure it was
to the common people in Vienna to watch
their Archduke and his wife at the theatre.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
They sat in the royal box, not formally, one at
each end, as is the etiquette, but close, so close
that everyone knew they were holding each
other’s hands. They would look into each
other’s faces with smiles, to share the interest
and joy of what they beheld and heard. So the
lesser folk were fond of her, though the fine
Court circle could not forgive.</p>

<p>When she went to Berlin, the astute William
received her with a tremendous parade of
honour, which made him very popular with the
Archduke, as well as with the multitude that
espoused his cause. But it was only a hollow
show of recognition after all&mdash;a banquet elaborately
arranged with little round tables, so as to
avoid any question of precedence under the
cloak of the most friendly intimacy. Our
simpler-minded court had to decline her visit
at the Coronation on account of this same
difficulty of precedence. Whatever might be
done in Austria, this was insulting from
England. “But she is of better family than
many of your royalties,” said a Bohemian
magnate to us across the table at a dinner-party,
his blue eyes blazing. “She is of very
good family. She is”&mdash;tapping his capacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span>
shirt-front with a magnificent gesture&mdash;“she is
related to me!”</p>

<p>The petty malice of those whose prerogatives
had been infringed pursued her to her bloodstained
and heroic grave. To the last she was
denied all those dignities which appertained to
her husband’s rank. Her morganatic dust
could not be allowed to commingle with that
of royalty in the Imperial vault. The two who
had loved beyond etiquette were given a
huddled and secret midnight funeral; and
beside the Archduke’s coffin, covered with the
insignia of his state, that of his wife was
marked only by a pair of white kid gloves and
a fan.</p>

<p>Such a pitiful triumph of tyranny over the
majestic dead! Horrible juxtaposition of the
ineptitude of pomposity and the most royal
of consummations! Sophie and her mate must
have smiled upon it from their enfranchisement.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the doomed pair had not yielded
themselves to those Berlin blandishments their
fate might have been less tragic. There are
sinister rumours as to whose hand really fired
the revolver. We in England to-day may well
have come to believe that those whom the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
Kaiser most smiles upon are his chosen victims.
The laborious grin of the crocodile to the little
fishes is nothing to it; but England is rather a
big mouthful.</p>

<p>Already one is able to say that any death has
been merciful which has spared an Austrian
the sight of his country’s dissolution. We are
glad that our fairy godmother has not lived
to have her heart torn between England, her
adopted country, and her passionately loved
Hungary.</p>

<p>The cloud no bigger than a man’s hand in
the clear sky&mdash;shadow of the mailed fist&mdash;we
looked at it from over here with that stirring
of surface emotions that is scarcely unpleasant!
How horrible! we said. How wicked, how
cruel! The little bloodstained cloud! it hung in
horizons too far off to menace our island shores.
We were very sorry for the old Emperor,
pursued to the last, it seemed, by the inexplicable,
unremitting curse. “I have been spared
nothing,” he is reported to have said when the
news of the Archduke’s murder was broken to
him. Was he then in his own heart sheltering
the deadly spark that was to kindle the whole
world? We thought of the playmate of Brussels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
days with a romantic regret, and envied her a
little. Since one must die, what a good way it
was to go with one’s only beloved! And then,
in the full summer peace, the clouds suddenly
massed themselves, darkened, and spread.</p>

<p>“Austrian Ultimatum to Servia! World’s
Peace Threatened!” so read the newspaper
headlines, like the mutter of thunder running
from pole to pole. We saw without conviction.
It seemed too inconceivable that such a crime
could be committed in our century; and the
folly of it too manifest in face of the Slav
menace. And next came the crack and the
lightning glare&mdash;hideous illumination over undreamt-of
chasms!</p>

<p>Will any of us ever forget that Saturday to
Monday? War was declared on Russia; war
on France. Luxemburg territory was violated,
and rumour raced from one end of England to
the other: “We are going to stand aside; the
peace party is too strong!... We are not bound
by deed to France, only by an understanding.
England means to let her honour go down on
a quibble....”</p>

<p>We had guests in the house&mdash;a brother,
retired after hard service in the army; a slow-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span>spoken,
gentle-eyed man of law, who hid the
fiercest fire of British pugnacity under this
deliberately meek exterior. They were both
pessimistic, the soldier angrily so in his anxiety.
“I’ll never lift my head again in England!&mdash;I’ll
never go into a foreign country again! I’d be
ashamed!&mdash;Upon my word, I’ll emigrate!”</p>

<p>And the other gloomily: “From my experience
of this Government, it’s sure to do
the worst possible thing. I haven’t the least
hope.”</p>

<p>In our own hearts we had resolved, with
the soldier, that we would give up home and
country. Our thoughts turned to Canada.</p>

<p>The relief was proportionate to the hideousness
of the doubt. What though the cloud had
spread and spread till it reached right across
the sky, there was brilliant sunshine over
England&mdash;the light of honour.</p>

<p>Two ardent young patriots had visited us
unexpectedly in their car that Sunday night.
They brought small items of consolation. They
had been to Portsmouth. It was ready for
war. Fixed bayonets gleamed at every corner;
the port was closed. Both these youths were
full of martial plans. One was hurrying to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
London Scottish, the other northwards to put
all affairs in order before joining too. The
London Scottish boy obligingly kept us <i>au
courant</i> of the turn of events by telephone.
During the length of Sir Edward Grey’s speech
perverted extracts reached us and plunged us
into ever deeper gloom: “We are only to intervene
if French ports are bombarded....”</p>

<p>Then at midnight on Monday the bell rang.
“Belgian neutrality had been violated; general
mobilization was ordered.” It was war. And
we slept on the tidings with a strange peace.</p>

<p>Perhaps the universal feeling was most impressively
voiced by a Franciscan monk, who
said to us later (during the agonizing suspense
between Mons and the Marne): “Nothing can
be so bad as those days when we did not know
what the Government would do. Whatever
happens now, nothing can compare to that.
Shall I ever forget how we prayed?”</p>

<p>Little Brothers of Peace and Poverty, humble,
self-despoiled servants of the rule most rigid in
its tenderness, clamouring at the throne of God
for a thing of pride, a priceless possession&mdash;their
country’s honour! Paradox can scarcely
go further, it would seem. Yet, even before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
Mr. Chesterton pointed it out, most of us had
long ago accepted the fact that the deeper the
truth the more breathless the paradox. Is
there an Englishman among us who would
lift his voice to-day against the sacred precept:
<i>He that loses his life shall save it</i>?</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">It</span> is frequently said in letters from the front,
by the officer praising his men, or <i>vice versa</i>:
“A dozen things are being done every day that
deserve the Victoria Cross.” But if you speak
to one of these heroes of their own deeds, you
will invariably get the same answer: “I just
did my little bit.”</p>

<p>How immense a satisfaction it must be to
feel you’ve done your little bit! And how out
of it are the stay-at-homes! Yet we also have
our part to play&mdash;infinitesimal in comparison,
but still, we hope, of use&mdash;the minute fragment
that may be wanted in the fitting together of
the great jigsaw puzzle.</p>

<p>Our first little bit at the Villino when we
woke to activity after the stunning of the blow,
was obviously to house refugees. We wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
a friend prominent among the receiving committee,
and offered, as a beginning, to undertake
twelve peasants out of the thousands of
unfortunates flying from the face of the Hun.
From that charming but harassed lady we received
a grateful acceptance, announcing the
arrival of our families that afternoon&mdash;hour to
be fixed by telegram. We feverishly prepared
for their reception. We were ready to shelter
five; kind neighbours proposed to take in the
other seven. We had a fleet of motor-cars in
readiness, and Mrs. MacComfort, our cook,
concocted large jars of coffee and other articles
of food likely to be relished of the Belgian
palate. No telegram arrived; but to make up
for it, our telephone rang ceaselessly with
anxious inquiries from the assisting neighbours&mdash;inquiries
which very naturally became
rather irate as the hours went by, while we
took upon ourselves the apologies of the guilty.</p>

<p>Next day we ventured to address an inquiry
to the harassed lady. That was Saturday. On
Monday we received a distraught telegram:
“Will wire hour of train.” It reminded us of
the overdriven shop-assistant in the middle of
a seething Christmas crowd: “Will attend to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>
you in a minute, madam.” We felt the desire to
oblige; but it left us just where we were before.</p>

<p>On Wednesday an unknown Reverend
Mother telegraphed from an unknown convent:
“Are you prepared to receive two
Belgian families five o’clock to-day?”</p>

<p>This message was supplemented by another
from an equally unknown Canon of Westminster
Cathedral: “Sending twelve Belgians
to-day. Please meet four-twenty train.”</p>

<p>We had scarcely time to clutch our hair, for
it was already past three when a third despatch
reached us, unsigned, from Hammersmith:
“Two Belgian ladies seven children arriving
this afternoon five-five train. Please attend
station.”</p>

<p>The question was, were we to expect twelve
or thirty-six?</p>

<p>We rang up the devoted neighbours. We
increased our preparations for refreshment.
We spread out all the excellent cast-off
garments collected for the poor destitutes;
and we “attended” at the first train.</p>

<p>Before proceeding any further with the
narration of our thrilling experiences, we may
mention that eighteen Belgians appeared in all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
whom we succeeded in housing after singular
developments; the most unexpected people
showing a truly Christian charity, while
others, ostentatiously devoted to good works,
bolted their doors and hearts upon the most
frivolous excuse.</p>

<p>A neighbour of ours, in precarious health,
with a large family, a son lost in Germany, a
son-in-law at the front, and an infant grandchild
in the nursery, would, we think, have given
every room and bed in her house to the exiles.</p>

<p>“Only, please, do let me have a poor woman
with a baby,” she said. “I’d love to have something
to play with our little Delia.”</p>

<p>Another, a widow lady, with a large house
and staff of servants to match, and unlimited
means, was horrified at the idea of admitting
peasants anywhere within her precincts; and as
to a small child&mdash;“I might be having the visit
of a grand-nephew, and he might catch something,”
she declared down the telephone, in the
tone of one who considers her reason beyond
dispute.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About five-thirty the Villino opened its
portals to its first refugees. The two ladies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
with the seven children were fed, and half the
party conveyed farther on, we undertaking a
mother and three children, under three, and a
sprightly little <i>bonne</i>. The Villino is a small
house, and we had prepared for peasant women.
A bachelor’s room and a gay, double-bedded
attic&mdash;it has a paper sprawling with roses and
big windows looking across the valley&mdash;were
what we had permanently destined for the
sufferers. Matters were not facilitated by discovering
that our guests belonged to what is
called in their own land the high-burgherdom;
and that they, on their side, had been told to
expect in us the keepers of a “family pension.”</p>

<p>We do not know whether the unknown
Church dignitary, the mysterious Lady Abbess,
or the nameless wirer from Hammersmith were
responsible for the mistake. We do not think
it can have been our high-minded but harassed
friend of the Aldwych, as some six weeks later
we received a secretarial document from that
centre of activity, asking whether it was true
that we had offered to receive Belgians, and if
so: what number and what class would we
prefer to attend to? By that time, we may
mention, we had been instrumental in estab<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>lishing
about sixty of every variety in the
environs.</p>

<p>However, we had reason not to regret the
misunderstanding which brought Madame
Koelen under our roof.</p>

<p>It was “Miss Marie,” the Villino’s Signorina,
who went down to meet her, accompanied by
those kindly neighbours. Madame Koelen
descended from the railway-carriage in tears.</p>

<p>“Poor young thing,” we said, “it is only
natural she must be heart-broken&mdash;flying from
her home with her poor little children!”</p>

<p>The first bombardment of Antwerp had been
the signal for a great exodus from that doomed
city.</p>

<p>“We were living in cellars, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i> and
it was not good for the children, <i>vous savez</i>, so
my husband said: ‘You must go, <i>vite, vite</i>; the
last boats are departing.’ We had not half an
hour to pack up.”</p>

<p>It was a piteous enough spectacle. She had
a little girl not three, another not two, and a
three-months-old baby which she was nursing.
We thought of the poor distracted husband
and father; and the forlorn struggle on the
crowded boat; and the dreadful landing on un<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>known
soil, herded together as they were, poor
creatures! like a huddled flock of sheep; and
our hearts bled.</p>

<p>Towards evening, however, when calm settled
down again on the astonished Villino, and
Madame Koelen, having left her children asleep,
was able to enjoy Mrs. MacComfort’s choice
little dinner, she became confidential to the
young daughter of the house. She began by
telling us that we must not imagine that because
a name had a German sound that her husband’s
family had the remotest connection with the
land of the Bosch. On the contrary, he was of
Italian extraction; descended, in fact, from no
less a race than the Colonnas! Having thus
established her credentials, she embarked on
long rambling tales of the flight, copiously
interlaced with the name of an Italian gentleman;
“a friend of my husband”; a certain Monsieur
Mérino.</p>

<p>“When my husband was putting us on the
<i>remorqueur</i> at Flushing, we saw him standing
on the quay, <i>vous savez</i>, and then he said, <i>n’est-ce
pas</i>: ‘Ah, Mérino, are you going to England?
Then look after my wife!’”</p>

<p>And Monsieur Mérino had been so good,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
and Monsieur Mérino had amused the children,
and Monsieur Mérino was so anxious to know
how they were established, and Monsieur
Mérino would probably come down to see for
himself, and Monsieur Mérino was so droll!</p>

<p>We are very innocent people, and we accepted
Monsieur Mérino in all good faith. We announced
ourselves as happy to receive him;
we were touched by his solicitude. Madame
Koelen had surprisingly cheered, but there
was yet a cloud upon her brow.</p>

<p>“Still,” she said, “I do not think it was right
of my cousin to have accepted to dine alone
with Monsieur Mérino, and to have passed the
night in London in the same hotel with only
her little brother to chaperon her&mdash;a child of
eight, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i>&mdash;and she only eighteen, <i>vous
savez</i>, and expected in Brighton.”</p>

<p>We quite concurred. Monsieur Mérino’s halo
grew slightly paler in our eyes. Monsieur
Mérino ought not to have asked her, we said,
with great propriety.</p>

<p>Madame Koelen exploded.</p>

<p>“Ah, if you had seen the way she went on
with him on the boat! She was all the time
trying to have a flirt with him. Poor Monsieur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
Mérino! and God knows what <i>blague</i> she has
told him, for he was never at the station to see
us off, and he had promised to be there, <i>n’est-ce
pas?</i> Oh, I was so angry! <i>Cette Jeanne</i>, she
prevented him! I cried all the way down in
the train.”</p>

<p>Certainly she had been crying when we first
beheld her; and we who had thought!&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Madame Koelen was a handsome, sturdy
creature, who would have made the most
splendid model for anyone wishing to depict
a <i>belle laitière</i>. Short, deep-chested, and broad-hipped,
her strong, round neck supported a
defiant head with masses of blue-black hair;
she had a kind of frank coarse beauty&mdash;something
the air of a young heifer, only that
heifers have soft eyes, and her eyes, bright
brown, were hard and opaque; something the
air of a curious child, with a wide smile that
displayed faultless teeth, and was full of the
joy of life; the kind of joy the milkmaid would
appreciate! We could quite understand that
Monsieur Mérino should find her attractive.</p>

<p>Before the next day had elapsed we began
to understand her view of the situation also.
Like so many other Belgian women whom we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
have known, she had been married practically
from the convent, only to pass from one discipline
to another. The husband in high-burgherdom,
as well as in the more exalted
class, likes to pick out his wife on the very
threshold of the world, so that he can have
the moulding of her unformed nature; so that
no possible chance can be afforded her of
drawing her own conclusions on any subject.
The horizon of the Belgian <i>nouvelle-mariée</i> is
rigidly bound by her home, and the sole luminary
in her sky is her husband. She must bask
on his smiles, or not at all. And if the weather
be cloudy, she must resign herself and believe
that rain is good for the garden of her soul.
Presently the lesser luminaries appear in the
nursery, and then her cup of happiness is indeed
full; the fuller the happier!</p>

<p>“<i>Il ne me lâche pas d’une semelle!</i>” said an
exasperated little lady to us one day, referring
to the devoted companionship of a typical
husband.</p>

<p>No wonder, when Monsieur Mérino flashed
across the widening horizon of Madame Koelen
with comet-like brilliancy, that the poor
little woman should be thrilled and dazzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>When, on the morning after her arrival, the
papers announced an intermittent bombardment
of Antwerp, she screamed: “Ah, <i>par
exemple</i>, it is I who am glad not to be there!”
without the smallest show of anxiety on the
score of the abandoned Koelen. We realized
that, to quote again our frank and charming
friend: “<i>Ce n’était pas l’amour de son mari qui
l’étouffait!</i>” And when she next proceeded to
hang on to the telephone, and with many
cackles and gurgles to hold an animated conversation
with the dashing Mérino, we began
to hope that that gentleman might not make
his appearance at the Villino.</p>

<p>He did, however, next day; and, under pretence
of visiting houses, carried away the
emancipated Madame Koelen for a prolonged
motor drive, leaving the three-months-old baby
to scream itself into fits in the attic room upstairs;
she was tied into her crib while the
little <i>bonne</i> promenaded the other two in the
garden.</p>

<p>The Villino is a tender-hearted place, and
the members of the <i>famiglia</i> vied with
each other in endeavouring to assuage the
agonies of the youngest Miss Koelen, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
nobody could provide the consolation she required.</p>

<p>Madame Koelen and her <i>cavaliere servente</i>
returned for a late tea, no whit abashed;
indeed, extremely pleased with themselves.
He had a great deal to say in an assured and
airy manner, and she hung on his words with
her broad smile and many arch looks from
those brilliant opaque red-brown orbs.</p>

<p>Monsieur Mérino was tall, quite good-looking;
with a smooth olive face, fair hair, and eyes
startlingly blue, in contrast to the darkness of
his skin. He gave us a great deal of curious
information. Summoned from Antwerp, where
he had a vague business, he was on his way to
join the Italian colours, but, calling on the
Italian Ambassador in London, the latter had
given him leave to defer his departure for
another ten days. He was, therefore, able to
devote his entire attention to the interests of
Madame Koelen, which he felt would be most
reassuring to her husband.</p>

<p>We rather wondered why the Italian Ambassador
to the Court of St. James’s should
occupy himself with the movements of a casual
Italian merchant <i>en route</i> from Antwerp; or by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
what curious intermingling of international
diplomatic arrangements he should be able to
give military leave to a reservist; but we were
too polite to ask questions.</p>

<p>Monsieur Mérino departed with many bows
and scrapes and hand-shakes; and Madame
Koelen evidently found that existence by
comet light was worth having.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening she was very
communicative on the subject of this gentleman,
and several anecdotes of his drollery on board
ship were imparted to us. She had found out
that he was married&mdash;that was a funny thing,
<i>n’est-ce pas?</i> She had always heard of him
about Antwerp as a bachelor.</p>

<p>“We thought he was a friend of your husband’s,”
we faltered.</p>

<p>“Oh, a friend&mdash;a coffee-house acquaintance,
<i>tout au plus</i>!...</p>

<p>“It was very droll. It came about this way.
He was playing with little Maddy, and I said
to him: ‘Oh! the good Papa that you will
make when you marry.’ Judge of my astonishment
when he looks at me and says: ‘I am
married already! Yes,’ he said, ‘I am married,
and my wife lives at Sorrento; I see her once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
in six weeks when I make my voyage of
business. <i>J’ai des idées sur le mariage,’ il dit,
comme ça.</i>”</p>

<p>These ideas she next began to develop.</p>

<p>“‘I do not think one ought to be bound,’ he
says. ‘Do you not agree with me, Madame, a
man ought to be free?’ Oh, he was comic!”</p>

<p>“But,” we said, “we do not think that is at
all nice.” The Villino is very moral. Its
shocked atmosphere instantly made itself felt
on Madame Koelen. Her bright eye became
evasive.</p>

<p>“Of course I made him <i>la leçon</i> at once. Ah!
I very well made him understand I do not
approve of these <i>façons</i>. My husband teases
me; I am so serious, so rigid!”</p>

<p>Before we separated that evening she told us
in a disengaged voice that she would spend the
next day in London. Monsieur Mérino could
not rest, it transpired, knowing her in such
dangerous surroundings; so far from a station,
in a place so likely, from its isolated inland
position, to be the objective of the first German
raid. He was, therefore, going to occupy himself
about another home for her; and at the
same time he would take the opportunity of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
conducting her to the Consul, for “it seems,”
she said, “that I shall have to pay a <i>grosse
amende</i> if I do not go immediately in person to
register myself in London.”</p>

<p>“But the baby,” we faltered.</p>

<p>“Oh, the baby!”&mdash;she flicked the objection
from her&mdash;“the baby will get on very well with
Justine. Justine knows how to manage her.”</p>

<p>Justine was the minute <i>bonne</i> who had tied
the infant into the cot.</p>

<p>Then there was Monsieur Mérino. The more
we thought of it, the less we felt that Monsieur
Mérino was to be trusted. Luridly our
imagination worked; we saw ourselves left
with three small Koelens in perpetuity; we
pictured that baby screaming itself into convulsions.
We thought it quite probable that
we might never hear of its Mama again. And
poor Papa Koelen, the brave Anversois Garde
Civique, dodging bombs in ignorance of the
horrible happening!</p>

<p>The Master of the Villino was prevailed upon
to speak; in fact, to put his foot down. Next
morning he spoke, and crushed the incipient
elopement with a firm metaphorical tread.</p>

<p>“Madame, this plan seems to be rash in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
extreme. I cannot permit it to take place from
under my roof. I feel, justly or unjustly, a
mediocre confidence in Monsieur Mérino. You
will, if you please, wire to him that you are
prevented from meeting him.”</p>

<p>Madame Koelen became very white, and
though her opaque eyes flashed fury, she gave
in instantly; being a young Belgian wife, she
was accustomed to yield to masculine authority.</p>

<p>Again she hung on the telephone. We were
too discreet to listen, but radiance returned to
her countenance.</p>

<p>After lunch she explained the cause. Next
morning she and her whole family would depart.
Monsieur Mérino would himself convey
them to Brighton.</p>

<p>The mistress of the Villino is occasionally
troubled with an inconvenient attack of conscience&mdash;sometimes
she wonders if it is only
the spirit of combativeness. In this instance,
however, she felt it her duty to warn Madame
Koelen.</p>

<p>It was a brief but thrilling conversation.
Madame Koelen, her eldest little daughter on
her knee, occasionally burying her handsome
countenance in the child’s soft hair, was as cool<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
and determined, as silky and evasive as a lusty
young snake. She had a parry for every statement;
that she ate up her own words and
manifestly lied from beginning to end did not
affect her equanimity in the least. It was the
Signora who was nonplussed. There is nothing
before which the average honest mind remains
more helpless than the deliberate liar.</p>

<p>Monsieur Mérino was her husband’s oldest
friend. He was intimate with her whole family.
She herself had known him for years. She
was under his charge by her husband’s wishes.
She had probably been aware of his marriage,
but it had merely slipped her memory&mdash;not
having his wife with him in Antwerp made one
forget it. He was perfectly right to invite her
young cousin to dine with him, since she had
her brother to chaperon her. Certainly the
brother was grown up and able to chaperon
her! How extraordinary of us to imagine
anything different!</p>

<p>“You are young, and you do not know life,
my dear,” said the Signora at last, succeeding
in keeping her temper, though with difficulty.</p>

<p>Madame Koelen bit into Maddy’s curls. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
was quite evident she meant to know life. She
had got her chance at last, and would not let it
escape.</p>

<p>“I do not think,” said the unhappy hostess,
firing her final shot, “that your husband would
approve.”</p>

<p>The wife wheeled with a sudden savage
movement, not unlike that of a snake about to
strike.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah, voilà qui m’est bien égal!</i> That is my own
affair!”</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be said. We
wondered whether the Garde Civique had ever
had such a glimpse of the real Geneviève Koelen
as had just been revealed to us. Even to us it
was startling.</p>

<p>An extraordinary hot afternoon it turned out.
The sun was too blazing for us to venture
beyond the shadow of the house. We sat on
the terrace, and Madame Koelen wandered
restlessly up and down, biting at a rose. The
master of the Villino suddenly appeared among
us, all smiles.</p>

<p>“A telegram for you, Madame. I have just
taken it down on the telephone. It is from
your husband. He is coming here to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>He was very glad; it was the burden of
responsibility lifted. Not so, however, Madame
Koelen.</p>

<p>“From my husband? How droll!”</p>

<p>She snapped the sheet of paper and walked
away, conning it over.</p>

<p>We sat and watched her.</p>

<p>The garden was humming with heat. The
close-packed heliotrope beds in the Dutch
garden under the library window were sending
up gushes of fragrance. In the rose-beds
opposite, the roses&mdash;“General MacArthur,”
“Grüss aus Teplitz,” “Ulrich Brunner,” “Barbarossa”
(we hope these friendly aliens will
soon be completely degermanized), crimson
carmine, velvet scarlet, glorious purple&mdash;seemed
to be rimmed with gold in the sun-blaze. It
was a faultless sky that arched our world, and
the moor, already turning from silver amethyst
to the ardent copper of the burnt heather,
rolled up towards it, like a sleeping giant
wrapped in robes of state.</p>

<p>On such a day the inhabitants of the Villino
would, in normal times, have found life very
well worth living indeed; basking in the sun
and just breathing in sweetness, warmth, colour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>&mdash;aspiring
beauty, if this can be called living!
But in war time the subconsciousness of
calamity is ever present. Inchoate apprehension
of bad news from the front is massed
at the back of one’s soul’s horizon, so that one
lives, as it were, under the perpetual menace
of the storm.</p>

<p>The wonderful summer was being rent, laid
waste, somewhere not so very far away; and
the sun was shining, even as it was shining on
these roses, on blood outpoured&mdash;the best blood
of England! In the hot Antwerp streets, we
pictured to ourselves some tired man going to
and fro; the weight of the gun on his shoulder,
the weight of his heavy heart in his breast;
thinking of his wife and little children, hunted
exiles in a strange country, while duty kept
him, their natural protector, at his post in the
fated city.</p>

<p>To have seen what we read on that young
wife’s face would have been horrible at any time:
it was peculiarly at variance with the peace of
the golden afternoon, and the lovely harmony
of the garden. But in view of her country’s
desolation and her husband’s share in its
splendid and hopeless defence, it was hideous.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
We do not even think she had the dignity of a
<i>grande passion</i> for the fascinating Mérino; it
was mere vanity, the greed of a pleasure-loving
nature free to indulge itself at last. She was
only bent on amusing herself, and the unexpected
arrival of her husband interfered with
the little plan. Therefore she stood looking
at his message with a countenance of ugly
wrath.</p>

<p>“<i>Ah, ça, qu’il est ennuyeux!</i>... What has
taken him to follow me like this?”</p>

<p>The thoughts were printed on her face.</p>

<p>“Is it not delightful?” said the guileless
master of the Villino, who never can see evil
anywhere.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, indeed,” said she; “delightful!”</p>

<p>She could no more put loyalty into her tone
than into her features.</p>

<p>“Heaven help Koelen!” thought the Signora,
and was heartily sorry for the unknown, but
how glad, how indescribably thankful, that the
planned expedition had been prevented!</p>

<p>Dramatically soon after his telegram Monsieur
Koelen arrived&mdash;an exhausted, pathetic
creature. He had stood twelve hours in the
steamer because it was so packed with exiled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
humanity that there was not room to sit down.
He had exactly two hours in which to see his
wife, having to catch the night boat again from
Harwich. He had given his word of honour
to return to Antwerp within forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>We did not, of course, witness the meeting,
but it was a very, very <i>piano</i> Madame
Koelen who brought Koelen down to tea; and
it was a cold, steely look which his tired eyes
fixed upon her between their reddened eyelids.
Whether he really came to put his valuables in
the bank, whether he was driven by some
secret knowledge or suspicion of his wife’s
character, we shall never know. We naturally
refrained from mentioning the name of Monsieur
Mérino. The host deemed his responsibility
sufficiently met by a single word of
advice:</p>

<p>“Madame is very young; we hope you will
place her with people you know.”</p>

<p>Monsieur Mérino was mentioned, however,
by the husband himself. It transpired Madame
owed him money. She wished to see him
again to pay him.</p>

<p>“I will pay him,” said Monsieur Koelen
icily; “I will call at his hotel on my way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Madame’s head drooped.</p>

<p>“<i>Bien, mon chéri</i>,” she murmured, in a faint
voice.</p>

<p>In a turn of the hand, as they would have
said themselves, her affairs were arranged.
She was to go to Eastbourne, under the care
of some elderly aunts, Monsieur Koelen
presently announced.</p>

<p>We had thought he looked like a hunted
hare. He had that expression of mortal agony
stamped on his face, which is often seen&mdash;more
shame for us!&mdash;on some poor dumb creature in
terror for its life; but he had still enough spirit
in him to reduce Madame Koelen to abject
submission.</p>

<p>We could see he was oppressed with melancholy:
that his heart was bursting over the
children. We understood that this parting
was perhaps worse for him than those first
rushed farewells.</p>

<p>He seemed scarcely to have arrived before
he was gone again. The young wife must have
had some spark of feeling left&mdash;perhaps, after
all, under the almost savage desire for a fling
she had a stratum of natural affection, common
loyalty&mdash;for she wept bitterly after his depar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>ture,
and, that night, for the first time, came
into the little chapel and prayed.</p>

<p>We met the nurse with the children in the
garden, just as the father was being driven
away: a small, upright creature this, with flax-blue
eyes and corn-coloured hair, which she
wore in plaits tightly wound round her head.
She did not look a day more than sixteen, but
she had the self-possession of forty; and
possessed resource also, as was demonstrated
by her dealings with Baby.</p>

<p>“Monsieur is so sad. Madame is so sad,
because of Antwerp, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i>” she said to us,
and by the sly look in those blue eyes we saw
that she was in her mistress’s confidence.</p>

<p>It was true that he was sad for Antwerp; if
the word “sad” can be used to describe that
bleak despair which we have noticed in so
many Belgian men who have found shelter
in this country.</p>

<p>“It is impossible that Antwerp should hold
out,” he said to us; “the spies and traitors
have done their work too well. The spies are
waiting for them inside our walls. They know
every nook in every fort, every weak spot
better than we do ourselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>That was mid September, and we put his
opinion down to a very natural pessimism.
No one knew then of the concrete platform
under the gay little villa outside the walls,
built by the amiable German family who was
so well known and respected at Antwerp; and
we have since heard, too, of the shells supplied
by Krupp and filled with sand; and the last
Krupp guns made of soft iron, which crumpled
up after the first shot.</p>

<p>Alas, he was justified in his gloomy prophecy!
But we do not think that it was as much the
sense of national calamity that overwhelmed
him as the acute family anxiety. Yet, honest,
good, severe, ugly little man&mdash;worth a hundred
plausible, handsome, lying scamps such as
Mérino&mdash;he was a patriot before all else! He
would have had a very good excuse, we think,
for delaying another twelve hours to place his
volatile spouse in safety with the elderly relations
at Eastbourne&mdash;but he had given his
word. Had he arrived at the Villino only to
find that she had tripped off to London, with that
chance acquaintance of cafés, Monsieur Mérino
(to whose care he had in a distraught moment
committed her); had he thereafter been assailed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>
by the most hideous doubts; had he believed,
as we did, that she meant to abandon husband
and babes at this moment of all others; or
had he&mdash;scarcely less agonizing surmise!&mdash;trembled
for her, innocent and lost in London,
the prey of a villain, we yet believe that he
would have kept his word.</p>

<p>“<i>J’ai donné ma parole d’honneur!</i>”</p>

<p>What a horrible, tragic story it might have
been, fit for the pen of a Maupassant! We
shall never cease to be thankful that it did not
happen. That is why we are glad to have
received Madame Koelen at the Villino.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our next refugees came to us quite by accident,
and then only for a meal. A home had
already been prepared for them in the village,
but the excellent Westminster Canon, who
seemed to be the channel through which the
stream of refugees was pouring to us, announced
five, and casually added a sixth at the
last minute, with the result that the party were
not recognized at the station. The name of
the Villino having become unaccountably associated
with every refugee that arrives in this
part of the world, the Van Heysts landed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
<i>en masse</i> at our doors, demanded to have their
cab paid, and walked in.</p>

<p>We all happened to be out, and Juvenal, our
eccentric butler, acquiesced. Standing on one
leg afterwards, he explained that, being aware
of our ways, he didn’t know, he was sure, but
what we might have meant to put them somewhere.</p>

<p>Weary, tragic creatures, we weren’t sorry,
after all, to speed them on their road! The
three fair-haired children were fed with bread-and-butter,
and the young mother talked
plaintively in broken French, while the old
grandfather nodded his head corroboratively.
But the father: he was like a creature cast in
bronze&mdash;would neither eat nor speak. He sat
staring, his chin on his hand, absorbed in the
contemplation of outrage and disaster.</p>

<p>They were from Malines.</p>

<p>“And then, mademoiselle, it was all on fire,
and the cannon were sending great bombs; and
we fled as quick as we could, <i>n’est-ce pas?</i> I with
the littlest one in my arms, and the other two
running beside me. For five hours we walked.
Yes, mademoiselle, the two little girls, they
went the whole way on foot, and that one there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
always crying, ‘<i>Plus vite, maman! plus vite,
maman!</i>’ and pulling at my apron.”</p>

<p>The young husband sat staring. Was he
for ever beholding his little house in flames,
or what other vision of irredeemable misery?
He remains inconsolable. Poor fellow! he has
heart disease; he thinks he will never see his
native land again. And there is yet another
little one expected. Alas! alas!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of quite another calibre are the Van Sonderdoncks;
a very lively, cheery family this! There
are, of course, a grandpapa, a maiden aunt, a
couple of cousins, as well as the bustling materfamilias,
the quaint wizened papa, the well-brought-up
Jeanne, who can embroider so
nicely, and the four little pasty boys with red
hair and eyes like black beads. They are comfortably
established in a very charming house
lent by a benevolent lady, who also feeds
them.</p>

<p>On the Signorina’s first visit she found
Madame Van Sonderdonck in a violent state
of excitement. She had received such extraordinary
things in the way of provisions “<i>de
cette dame</i>.” If mademoiselle would permit it,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
she would like to show her something&mdash;but
something&mdash;she could not describe it; it was
<i>trop singulier</i>. “One moment, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>She fled out of the room and returned with&mdash;a
vegetable marrow!</p>

<p>She was rather disappointed to find that
mademoiselle was intimately acquainted with
this freak of nature, which she surveyed from
every angle with intense suspicion and curiosity.
Politeness kept her from expressing her real
feelings when she was assured of its excellence
cooked with cheese and onion and a little
tomato in a flat dish, but her countenance expressed
very plainly that she was not going to
risk herself or her family.</p>

<p>Having failed to impress with the marrow,
she repeated the effect with sago. She had
eaten it raw. Naturally, having thus become
aware of its real taste, she could not be expected
to believe it would be palatable in any guise.
Nevertheless, she was indulgent to our eccentricities.
If anyone remembers the kind of
amused, condescending interest that London
society took in the pigmies, when those unfortunate
little creatures were on show at
parties a few years ago, they can form some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
idea of Madame Van Sonderdonck’s attitude
of mind towards England.</p>

<p>Good humour reigned in the family as we
found it.</p>

<p>Though papa Sonderdonck had a bayonet
thrust through his neck&mdash;he had been in the
Garde Civique&mdash;and they had already had a
battle-royal with the Belgian family who shared
the house, they seemed to view the whole situation
as a joke. As they had routed their fellow
refugees&mdash;the latter only spoke Flemish, Madame
Van Sonderdonck only French, and an interpreter
had to be found to convey mutual abuse&mdash;and
furthermore obtained in their place the
sister-in-law and the two cousins, unaccountably
left out of the batch, they had some substantial
reasons for satisfaction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monsieur and Madame Deens are once
more of the heart-rending order. She, a
pathetic creature always balanced between
tears and smiles, with pale blue eyes under
her braided soft brown hair, looks extraordinarily
young to be the mother of two
strapping children. He is the typical Belgian
husband, devoted but grinding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>Our first visit there was painful. Madame
Deens was like a bewildered child, and the
husband, a stalwart handsome fellow, who had
been chief engineer on the railway at Malines,
was torn between a very natural indignation at
finding himself beggared after years of honest
hard work, and bitter anxiety about his wife,
who was in the same condition as Madame Van
Heyst.</p>

<p>He beckoned us outside the cottage to tell
us in a tragic whisper that he had good reason
to believe that “all, all the family of my wife,”
her father, mother, and the invalid sister, had
been murdered by the Germans; and their farm
burned.</p>

<p>“How can I tell her, and she as she is? It
will kill her too! And she keeps asking me
and asking me! I shall have to tell her!”</p>

<p>The tears rolled down his cheeks. Yet he
was a hard man; it galled him to the quick to
be employed as a common labourer and receive
only seventeen shillings a week.</p>

<p>They had been given a gardener’s house:
the most charming, quaint abode. It had an
enormous kitchen, with a raftered ceiling, and
one long window running the whole length of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
the room, opening delightfully on the orchard.
The walls were all snowy white. He might
have made himself very happy in such surroundings
for the months of exile, with the
consciousness of friends about him, the knowledge
of safety and care for the wife in her
coming trial, and the splendid healthy air for
the children. But Deens was not satisfied.</p>

<p>“I had just passed my examinations, <i>n’est-ce
pas?</i> monsieur, madame, and had received my
advancement, and we had just got into the
little house I had built with my savings. Now
it is burnt&mdash;burnt to the ground. And these
wages, for a man like me, mademoiselle, it is
something I cannot bring myself to. <i>Je ne puis
pas m’y faire, savez vous.</i>”</p>

<p>“But Madame Deens is so well here, and we
will look after her,” said Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>“Ah, but I could earn more money elsewhere!
I might have something to bring back
to my own country.”</p>

<p>Of course he has had his way. A bustling lady
got him into a motor factory, and he dragged
his weeping but resistless spouse to a townlet,
where they are lodged in one room; where the
only person we could think of to interest in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
their favour was the old parish priest, who
turned out to be queer in his head, but where
Deens is in receipt of thirty-two shillings a
week. We are sure that what can be saved
is being saved for the <i>retour au pays</i>, and meanwhile
the poor little woman’s hour of trouble is
approaching, and she must get through it as
best she can, unbefriended. We feel anxious.</p>

<p>Before she left, with many tears, she gave
the Signorina, who had sympathized with her,
the only gift she could contrive out of her
destitution. It was the youngest child’s little
pair of wooden shoes!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br />
OUR MINISTERING ANGELS</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“Chi poco sa, presto lo dice!”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Wisdom of Nations.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">Of</span> course we are not behindhand in our village
in the Red Cross movement.</p>

<p>Nearly every woman, whatever her views,
fancies herself nowadays in the rôle of ministering
angel. It may be doubted whether an
existence devoted to the Tango and its concomitants
has been a useful preparation for a
task which demands the extreme of self-devotion;
and we have heard odd little tales of how
a whole body of charming and distinguished
amateurs rushed into the cellars at the whiz of
a shell, abandoning their helpless patients; and
how the fair chief of a volunteer ambulance
staff fainted at the sight of the first wounded
man.</p>

<p>Yet there may be many, even among what is
odiously called “the smart set,” who only find
their true vocation at such a moment as this,
when unsuspected qualities, heroic capacities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
spring into life at the test. It is not enough to
say that times of great calamity sift the good
from the bad, the strong from the futile: they
give the wasters in every class of life their
chance of self-redemption&mdash;in numberless
instances not in vain. While freely admitting,
however, that there may be a good proportion
of society women who are drawn to work
among the wounded by a genuine desire to
help, and have therefore taken care to qualify
themselves for the task, who can deny that
with others nursing is merely a new form of
excitement, the last fashionable craze? It was
the same in the South African War. Indeed,
the episode of the wounded soldier who put
up a little placard with the inscription, “Much
too ill to be nursed to-day,” has, we see, been
revived in connection with the present conflict.
It may be taken as the classic expression of
Tommy’s feelings towards this particular form
of attention. We do not suppose, however,
that the case of the tender-hearted but unenlightened
lady who went about Johannesburg
feeding the enteric patients with buns
will be allowed to repeat itself at Boulogne
or Calais. We well remember reading her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span>
letter to the papers, in which she innocently
vaunted her fatal ministrations, inveighing
against the monstrous fashion in which “our
poor sick soldiers” were being starved. We
believe eleven victims of her charity died.</p>

<p>A late distinguished general had a genial
little anecdote anent the energies of a batch
of fair nurses who landed in Egypt during the
last campaign. Happening to go round the
hospital one morning shortly after their arrival,
he saw one of these enchanting beings, clad in
the most coquettish of nursing garbs, bending
over a patient.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it refresh you if I were to sponge
your face and hands, my man?” she inquired,
in dulcet tones.</p>

<p>The patient, who was pretty bad, rolled a
resigned but exhausted glance at her.</p>

<p>“If you like, mum. It’s the tenth time it’s
been done this morning!”</p>

<p>Perhaps, like the war itself, everything is on
too tremendous a scale now to permit of such
light-hearted playing with the dread sequels of
combat. We can no more afford to make a
game of nursing than a game of fighting in
this world struggle. It is possible that only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
such of our <i>mondaines</i> as have the necessary
knowledge and devotion are permitted to have
charge of those precious lives, and that the
others confine themselves to post-cards and
coffee-stalls, and dashing little raids into the
firing-lines with chocolates and socks. We
trust it may be so. We confess that what we
ourselves beheld of the local amateur Red
Cross fills us with some misgiving.</p>

<p>Of course, as has been said, being a very
enlightened community, we were not going to
be left behind. A special series of lectures
was announced almost within a week of the
declaration of war. The daughter of the household
determined to join.</p>

<p>On her arrival, a little late, at the village hall,
she was met by the secretary of the undertaking;
a charming and capable young lady,
looking, however, at this particular moment
distraught to the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>do</i> you know anything about home
nursing? <i>Do</i> you think you could teach a little
class how to take temperatures? You could
easily pick up what you want to learn afterwards,
couldn’t you? There are such a lot
of them, and they’re all so, so&mdash;&mdash;” She sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>stituted
“difficult to teach” for the word
trembling on her lips. “Nurse Blacker doesn’t
know which way to turn.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can certainly teach them to take temperatures,”
said the Signorina. Nurses, like
poets, are born, not made; and she is of those
who have the instinct how to help. Besides
this she has had experience.</p>

<p>She was disappointed, however. She had come
to learn, not to teach. It seemed to her, moreover,
almost inconceivable that any female who
had arrived at years of discretion and was of
normal intellect should not be able to take a
temperature; but she swallowed her feelings,
after the example of the secretary, and went
briskly in to begin her task.</p>

<p>She was provided with a jug of warm water,
several thermometers, and a row of various
women, ranging from the spinster of past sixty
to the red-cheeked sixteen-year old daughter of
the local vet&mdash;who ought to have known how
to take a temperature, if it was only a dog’s!
There were also two fluttering beribboned
summer visitors from the neighbouring hotel;
these were doing the simple life, with long motor
veils and short skirts and a general condescend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>ing
enthusiasm towards our wild moorland
scenery, which they were fond of qualifying as
“too sweet!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the secretary to the Signorina
as she hurried away, “you could teach
them to take a pulse also. They can practise
on each other. It would be <i>such</i> a help.”</p>

<p>The Signorina felt a little shy. It did seem
somewhat presuming for anything so young as
she was to be instructing people who were all,
with the exception of the vet’s daughter, considerably
older, and, therefore, obviously considerably
richer in experience than herself. It
added to her embarrassment that the summer
visitors should fix two pairs of rapt eyes upon
her with the expression of devotees listening
to their favourite preacher.</p>

<p>However, she summoned her wits and her
courage, and gave a brief exposition of the
mysteries of thermometer and pulse, patiently
repeating herself, while the students took
copious notes. Certainly there was something
touching in this humble ardour for useful knowledge.
Then the thrilling moment of practice
began.</p>

<p>The spinster first monopolized the instruct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>ress’s
attention. Her white hairs and her years
entitled her to precedence.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she remarked, with the air of
one whose scientific education has not been
altogether neglected, as she balanced her thermometer
over the jug, “the water won’t really
make it go up, will it, no matter how hot it is?”</p>

<p>The Signorina did not think she could have
understood.</p>

<p>“I mean,” said the maiden lady, waving the
little tube, “it’s not heat that will ever make
the thermometer go up. It’s fever, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But fever is heat,” mildly asserted the
“home-nurse.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, I don’t mean <i>that</i>” said the spinster
loftily. “Of course, I know you’re hot with
fever; but it’s something <i>in</i> you, isn’t it, that
affects the thermometer? It wouldn’t go up,
even if I put it on the stove, would it?”</p>

<p>“Put it into the jug and try,” said the Signorina,
who did not believe that language would
be much use here.</p>

<p>“Oh, I think,” interpolated a summer guest
who was much impressed by the spinster’s
grasp of the situation, “I’d rather try my thermometer
on my cousin, please! I think one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
would learn better. It would be more like
hospital practice, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>The spinster turned from the jug with
alacrity.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you are right,” she cried. Then
wheeling on her neighbour: “Oh, would you
mind?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>The neighbour, a tailor-made lady with a
walking-stick, who looked on with a twisted
smile&mdash;we suspect she was a suffragette, pandering
to the weakness of a world distracted
from the real business of life&mdash;submitted to be
made useful. Her smile became accentuated.</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t mind if it was a cigarette,” she
remarked in a deep bass, and thereafter was
silent, while the spinster laboriously prepared
to take two minutes on her watch.</p>

<p>“Please, dear child,” cried one of the motor-veiled
ladies in her impassioned tone of interest,
“will you explain to me again, what is normal?
<i>I’d better take it out, dear! There’s no use doing
it wrong, is there?</i> You said something about
a little red line&mdash;or is that for fever? How
silly I am&mdash;red would be for fever, wouldn’t
it? No? <i>Red is normal, darling. Oh, I do
hope you’re normal!</i> What did you say, ninety-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>eight,
point four? I never could do arithmetic
and I’m so stupid. My husband always says&mdash;<i>doesn’t
he, Angela?</i>&mdash;‘You won’t do much adding
up, Birdie’&mdash;he calls me ‘Birdie,’&mdash;‘but I can
trust you to subtract all right,’ dear, naughty
fellow! He loves me to spend, you know,
<i>doesn’t he, Angela?</i> Oh dear, it hasn’t moved
at all! Is that very bad? <i>Angela, darling!</i>”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t leave it in two minutes,”
said the persevering teacher. “Supposing you
were to put it in your mouth now, and your
cousin were to take you?”</p>

<p>“Will you, Angela?” The summer visitor’s
eyes became pathetic. “I’m sure I’ve been
feeling quite dreadful with all this anxiety.”</p>

<p>“Your temperature,” said the spinster triumphantly
to the suffragette, “is a hundred
and twenty-eight.”</p>

<p>The Signorina started.</p>

<p>“But that’s quite impossible! Look here, let
me show you. It won’t mark over a hundred
and ten.”</p>

<p>For the first time the spinster was flustered.</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps I read it wrong! Let me look
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>After much fumbling and peering she became
apologetic.</p>

<p>“I see I did make a mistake. It’s twenty-six.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said the little lecturer hopelessly,
“if I just went over the readings of the
thermometer with you all once more&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But she was interrupted.</p>

<p>“Would you mind”&mdash;the harassed secretary
seized her by the elbow&mdash;“would you mind
coming to superintend the bed-making? I’ve
got to take the bandage class, and Nurse
Blacker can’t really manage more than twenty
with the compresses.”</p>

<p>The whole room was full of the clapper of
excited female tongues. The Signorina was not
sorry to leave the jug of warm water and the
extraordinary fluctuating temperatures. She
was followed by the summer visitors, motor
veils and ribbons flying.</p>

<p>As she left, a cheerful, red-faced lady was
heard to announce casually, as she dropped the
fat wrist of the veterinary’s daughter, that
there was no use her trying to take that pulse,
as the girl hadn’t got any.</p>

<p>The clamorous group surrounded the camp-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>bed,
upon which was stretched a sardonic boy-scout,
fully clothed, down to his clumping
boots. He was aged about twelve, and assisted
in the education of the “lidies” by commenting
from time to time on their efforts in hoarse
tones of cynicism. After one impulsive neophyte
had seemed to be practising tossing him
in a blanket, he remarked into space: “Nurses
are not suppowsed to move the pytient.”</p>

<p>And to another who jerked his heels up:
“Down’t you forget, miss, I’m a bad caise!”</p>

<p>The Signorina had never been taught how
to make beds in the true hospital fashion
before, and was painstakingly absorbed in the
intricacies of rolling sheets without churning
the “bad caise,” when she was seized upon by
one of the flutterers from the hotel.</p>

<p>“We’re going now; it’s been <i>so</i> interesting,
we <i>have</i> enjoyed it. I shan’t forget all you told
me about temperatures. I feel quite able to
look after our dear fellows already. Oh! I
<i>must</i> tell you. You’ve got such a sympathetic
face. I’m sure you will understand. I had
a most <i>wonderful</i> revelation the other day, in
church&mdash;in London, you know. I had such an
extraordinary feeling&mdash;just as if something came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
over me&mdash;and I thought the church was full of
dead soldiers; and a voice seemed to say to
me: ‘Pray.’ I felt quite uplifted. And then
in a minute it was all gone. Wasn’t it wonderful?
That kind of thing makes one feel so
<i>strong</i>, doesn’t it? Oh, I knew you would
understand. The last news is <i>very</i> disquieting,
isn’t it? What a darling little
fellow!”</p>

<p>The “bad caise” scowled at her horribly;
but the sweetness of her smile was quite unimpaired,
as she fluttered out of the hall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“It is very important,” said Nurse Blacker
to the compress class, “that the nurse should
wash her hands before touching the patient’s
wounds.”</p>

<p>“Now, tell me, Sister,” interposed a meek
voice, “is that precaution for the nurse’s sake
or for the patient’s? I mean, I suppose it’s in
case the nurse should incur any infection from
the wound?”</p>

<p>This point of view&mdash;that of the White
Queen in “Alice Through the Looking-Glass”&mdash;had
not apparently struck Nurse Blacker
before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>It all seems too ridiculous to be true, but yet
the facts are here set down as they actually
occurred.</p>

<p>We think there are a good many women
about the world of the type of the spinster and
her sisters, and we are also convinced that it
would be quite impossible to succeed in impressing
upon such minds even the most rudimentary
notions of nursing; yet it is likely
enough they may all have been granted certificates
eventually. Professionals are dreadfully
bored in dealing with amateurs, and are
often glad to take the shortest road to deliverance.</p>

<p>We were once witness, in pre-war days, of
the examination of a Red Cross class in the
north of England. There was a weary doctor
on the platform with a bag of bones; and a
retired hospital nurse, very anxious to be on
good terms with the delightful family who
were the chief organizers of the movement,
had charge of the “show.”</p>

<p>The doctor gave a brief address upon dislocation.
It ran somewhat in this fashion.</p>

<p>“Dislocation is the misplacement of a joint.
It is indicated by the symptoms of swelling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
redness, pain, and inability to move the limb.
There is no crepitation as in a fracture. As to
treatment: my advice to you, ladies, when you
meet a case of this kind, is&mdash;ahem&mdash;to leave it
severely alone and to send for a medical man.”</p>

<p>The class took copious notes. The doctor
dropped the two bones with which he had
been demonstrating into the bag again, leant
back in his chair and closed his eyes. His part
of the transaction was concluded. It had been
most illuminating, the ladies agreed, and the
Signorina’s chauffeur, who has a yearning
towards general self-improvement, remarked
to her on the way home:</p>

<p>“Ow”&mdash;like the boy scout, he has a theatrically
cockney accent&mdash;“I am glad to know what
to do for discollation. I’d never studied that,
loike, before.”</p>

<p>While the doctor leant back and rested, the
hospital nurse examined each student privately
on the subject of the previous instructions.
The Signorina happened to be quite close to a
little old lady with bonnet and strings, and a
small, eager, withered, agitated face under
bands of frizzled grey hair&mdash;the kind of little
old lady who is always ready to respond to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
call of duty, and who is in the van of knitters
for “our dear, brave soldiers” or “our gallant
tars.”</p>

<p>“What,” said the hospital nurse tenderly,
“would you do for a bed-sore?”</p>

<p>The little old lady began to twitter and
flutter:</p>

<p>“I would first wash the place with warm
water, and&mdash;oh, dear me, dear me, I <i>did</i> know,
I knew quite well a minute ago&mdash;with, with
something to disinfect.”</p>

<p>“It is something to disinfect, quite right,”
approved the nurse.</p>

<p>“A salt, I think&mdash;I’m sure it was. I could
get it at the chemist&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the nurse, as if she were
speaking to a child of two years old, “the
chemist would be sure to keep it. It’s quite a
simple thing. But you would have to know
what to ask for, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, yes. P&mdash;p&mdash; or did it begin
with an I?”</p>

<p>“Perchloride of mercury,” said the nurse,
smothering a yawn.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” cried the little old lady, delighted,
“that’s it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“Well, now you know it, don’t you,” said
the nurse brightly, wrote “Passed” in her
notebook, and turned to the next.</p>

<p>“How much liquid nourishment would you
give a typhoid patient at a time?”</p>

<p>This to a village girl, who looked blank, not
to say terrified, and wrung her hands in her
lap.</p>

<p>“I mean,” helped the questioner, “if the
patient were put on milk&mdash;a milk diet, very
usual in typhoid cases&mdash;how much milk would
you give at a time?”</p>

<p>The girl’s face lit up.</p>

<p>“Two quarts, miss,” she said with alacrity.</p>

<p>“Not at a time, I think,” corrected the examiner,
quite unruffled. “Two quarts, perhaps,
in the twenty-four hours, if you could get the
patient to take it&mdash;that would be splendid.
Typhoid is a very weakening malady. It’s a
good thing to keep the strength up&mdash;if you <i>can</i>,
you know.”</p>

<p>The Signorina heard this optimist make her
report a little later to the charming daughter
of the charming family, who had herself studied
to good purpose, but was too modest to undertake
the instructions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“They’ve all answered beautifully. Look at
my notebook&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>It was “Passed,” “Passed,” to every name.</p>

<p>“That <i>is</i> good,” said the gratified organizer.
“We <i>have</i> done well to-day.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No doubt one occasionally comes across odd
specimens even among professionals. Certainly,
during a long illness with which the
Signora was afflicted a couple of years ago,
three of the five nurses who succeeded each
other in attendance upon her cannot be said to
have lightened the burthen.</p>

<p>The first, sent for at eleven o’clock at night,
distinguished herself by instantly upsetting a
basin of hot water into the patient’s bed. As
she repeated the process next night, and greeted
the accident with shrieks of laughter, it could
scarcely be regarded as the exceptional breach
which proves the rule of excellence.</p>

<p>The Signora, who was not supposed to be
moved at all, has, fortunately, the sense of
humour which helps one along the troublesome
way of life, in sickness as in health. She
laughed too. The nurse, who was an Irishwoman,
immediately thought herself rather a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
wag. She was a little, vivacious creature, ugly,
but bright-eyed. She was extremely talkative,
and perhaps the most callous person the Signora
has ever come across. It is our experience
that all nurses are talkative. If the patient
wants to make life endurable at all, the talk
must be guided into the least disagreeable
channels.</p>

<p>The Signora’s dread is the tale of operations&mdash;“of
practice in the theatre,” which one of the
nurses of her youth told her she considered
“an agreeable little change.”&mdash;This particular
Dorcas’s favourite topic was deathbeds. The
patient was quite aware that the supreme experience
was a not at all impossible event for
herself in the near future, so she had a certain
personal interest in the matter. Anyhow, she
permitted the discourse.</p>

<p>She heard at full length the narration of
Nurse MacDermott’s first deathbed in private
nursing. It was a horrible anecdote, which
might have formed a chapter in a realistic
novel. “A gentleman at Wimbledon it was,”
evidently of the well-to-do merchant class, and
he seemed, poor man! to have been the unhappy
father of a family as cold-blooded and heartless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
as the wife in Tolstoi’s painful story of death.
But here there was no one to care, not even
a poor servant lad&mdash;not even the nurse whose
vocation it was to help him through the final
agony. She arrived at ten o’clock, and at
eleven the doctor warned the family that the
patient would not pass the night. Thereupon
everyone&mdash;the wife, two daughters, and a son&mdash;retired
to bed, and left the dying man in charge
of the newly arrived attendant, who sat down
to watch, reading a novel. About two o’clock
the moribund began to make painful efforts to
speak.</p>

<p>“Charlie, Charlie,” he kept saying.</p>

<p>“Ah, the poor fellow!” said the little nurse,
as she recounted the story, “he had a son who
was a scapegrace, it seems, off away somewhere,
and he wanted to send him a message.
I ran and called the wife out of her bed&mdash;what
do you think? She’d put her hair in crimpers!
Upon my word, she had; they were bristling
all round the head of her. Well, I didn’t want
to have him die on me while I was out of the
room, so I rushed back. And he made signs to
me. The power of speech was gone from him.
He wanted to write. I had a bit of pencil, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
there wasn’t a scrap of paper that I could see,
so there was nothing I could give him but the
fly-leaf of the book I was reading; and ah! the
poor fellow, it was only scrawls he could make
after all. And sure, he was dead before his
wife came in. And she just gave one look at him,
and, ‘I’m going back to bed,’ says she, and back
to bed she went. But it was the hair-curlers
that did for me. I never can forget them.”</p>

<p>She was sitting at the end of the Signora’s
bed, and doubled herself up with laughter
as she spoke. We have no doubt but that she
went back to her novel, scrawled with the
dying father’s last futile effort.</p>

<p>We never knew anyone quite so frankly
unmoved by the awful scenes it was her trade
to witness. She found vast amusement in the
wanderings of delirious patients. Whenever
she wanted to cheer the other nurses up, she
informed us, in the Home where they dwelt
together, she could always make them laugh
with little anecdotes from the typhoid ward;
and the “wanderings” from the different beds.</p>

<p>She tried to cheer the Signora up on these
lines; and the Signora, on wakeful nights, has
to force her mind away from the “humorous”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
memories. She infinitely preferred the story
of Nurse McDermott’s love affairs. Like many
ugly people, the young woman believed herself
irresistible, and paid a great deal of attention
to the conservation of her charms. Once,
having settled her patient for the night, she
reappeared unexpectedly <i>en robe de chambre</i>.</p>

<p>“I have just come to tell you how many
creams I have put on myself,” she cried to the
bewildered lady. “I know it will amuse you!
There’s the pomade for my hair, and Valaze
for my face, and the lanoline for my neck. I
do hate the mark of the collar&mdash;for evening
dress, you know&mdash;it gives one away so! And
there’s the salve for my lips, and the cold cream
for my hands, and the polish for my nails&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She went away in a hurry to a bad case
at Liphurst, jubilating because we were paying
her journey, and she would get it out of the
other lady also, and the doctor had offered
to send her in his car.</p>

<p>Of quite another type was Nurse Vischet.
No one could say that she was unaffected by
her patient’s symptoms. They had the power
of flinging her into frenzy. Capable enough
when things were going fairly well with her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
charge, the first shadow of a change for the
worse produced in her what can only be
described as fury. Her face would become
convulsed, her eyes would flame, she would
knock the furniture about as she moved, and
could barely restrain herself from insulting
the sufferer.</p>

<p>At first the Signora, who was very ill and
weaker than it is possible to describe, could
not at all understand these outbursts. “What
can have annoyed Nurse?” she would wonder
feebly to herself. But presently she understood.
It was really a mixed terror of, and
repulsion from, the sight of suffering. Why
such a woman should have become a nurse,
and how she could continue in the service
of the sick, feeling as she did, remains a
mystery. The key to her extraordinary behaviour
was given one day by a little dog, who
happened to be seized with a very common
or garden fit of choking through the nose; such
as affects little dogs with slight colds in their
heads. Nurse Vischet started screaming.</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” said the Signora. “He
only wants his nose rubbed. Carry him over
to me if you won’t do it yourself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“Ugh!” shrieked Nurse Vischet. “I think
it’s dying. I wouldn’t touch it for the world!”</p>

<p>One of the symptoms of the human patient’s
illness were agonizing headaches, during which
she could scarcely bear a ray of light in the
room. In spite of frequent requests, Nurse
Vischet always seized the occasion to turn the
ceiling electric light full on the bed, and when
at last forbidden to do so, she declined to enter
a room in which she could not see her way.
The Signora gave her the name of her “ministering
devil.” She was a rabid Socialist, and
had peculiar theories, one of which we remember
was that condemned criminals should be
handed over to the laboratories for vivisection.</p>

<p>She had also to an acute degree the hospital
nurse’s capacity for upsetting the household.
Our butler, a hot-tempered man, happened
to drop a stray “damn” in the hearing of the
under-housemaid, and Vischet, hanging on the
landing over the kitchen regions, as she was
fond of doing, overheard the dread word. The
whole establishment was turned upside down.
Maggie was told that she “owed it to her
womanhood” not to allow foul language in her
presence. Maggie gave notice, but being,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
after all, an Irish girl with a sense of humour,
was as easily soothed down as she had been
worked up. Certainly, however, if we had
kept Nurse Vischet, we should have lost, one
by one, our excellent staff of servants. Besides
playing on their feelings against each other,
she had a horrible trick of telling them they
were at the last gasp upon the smallest ailment.
She did not like her patient to have symptoms;
but she encouraged the domestics to fly to her
with theirs.</p>

<p>Irish Maggie had an indigestion. Vischet
declared her condition to be of extreme gravity.
She rushed to the Signora with her tale.
Maggie was ordered to bed. Vischet produced
an immense tin of antiphlogistine with
which to arrest “the mischief.”</p>

<p>The daughter of the house went up to visit
the sick girl, and came down laughing to console
her mother.</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about Maggie,” she said,
and gave a pleasant little description of the
scene and the invalid’s remarks.</p>

<p>“Ah, sure I’m all right, miss. It’s all along
of a bit of green apple. Sure, Mrs. MacComfort
has just given me a drop of ginger, and it’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
done me a lot of good already. Do you see
what Nurse is after bringing me? God bless
us all, wouldn’t I rather die itself than be
spreading that putty on me! I’ll be up for tea,
miss.”</p>

<p>“She looks as rosy as possible,” went on the
comforter, “and ever so nice with her hair in a
great thick plait tied with ribbons, grass green,
for Ireland.”</p>

<p>Through one recollection Vischet will always
remain endeared to the mind of her victim;
and that was for her singular pronunciation.
There was a story to which the Signora was
fond of leading up relating to por-poises,
(pronounced to rhyme with noises), and another
connected with a tor-toise, which happened to
be the pet of a recent “case.” There was also
a little tale of a dog: “I was out walking on
the embankment,” said Vischet, “and I saw a
man coming along leading two dogs&mdash;one was
a great bulldog, and the other was one of those
queer creatures you call a dashun” (the Signora
prides herself on her intelligence for instantly
discovering that the narrator meant a dachshund).
“And there was running about loose
the queerest animal ever I saw,” went on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
nurse; “it had the head of a bulldog and the
legs of a dashun.”</p>

<p>The third nurse was very different. The
daughter of an officer, who was seeking the
most genteel way to make her living, she frankly
handed over the chief of the attendance to the
Signora’s own devoted maid; which, on the
Signora becoming aware of her incapacity, she
was on the whole glad that she should do.
Nurse Fraser was a tall, handsome girl, who
was fond of sitting on the sofa at the foot of
the patient’s bed, her hands clasped round her
knees, staring into space. She was by no
means unamiable, but she was bored; and the
Signora, who rather liked her, was not averse
to screening her deficiencies. When the doctor
inquired after the temperature that had never
been taken, she herself would declare it had
been normal; and she was amused when Nurse
Fraser would next vouch for a “splendid breakfast.”
She not having appeared in her patient’s
room till noon.</p>

<p>She made no attempt to conceal her complete
inefficiency in the treatment of the case.</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>do</i> tell me what I’m to do,” she had
cried on arrival to the district nurse who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
come in as a stopgap. “I’m sure if I ever knew
anything about the illness I’ve quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>One day&mdash;she, too, was garrulous&mdash;she informed
her patient that her mother had shares
in Kentish Mines. “If ever they work out, we
may get a lot of money, and then,” she cried,
quite unconscious of offence, “no more beastly
sick people for me!”</p>

<p>She left us in tears. She had enjoyed herself
very much.</p>

<p>It would seem as if our experience had been
unfortunate, and yet it is not so; for surely to
have known two perfect nurses one after another
is sufficient to re-establish the balance. Chief
of these, first and dearest, was Nurse Dove.
She was the district nurse, called in, as we
have said, in a moment of emergency. How
Miss Nightingale would have loved her!
Blessed little creature, it was enough to restore
anybody’s heart to see her come into the sick-room,
quiet, capable, tender, her eyes shining
with compassion for the sufferer and eagerness
to relieve. She was as gentle as she was skilful:
to anyone who did not know her it would
be impossible to convey the extent of the virtue
contained in this phrase. The Signora would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
have placed herself, or, what means a great deal
more, her nearest and dearest, with the completest
confidence in her hands alone, in any
dangerous illness.</p>

<p>Among the poor she was an apostle. It
seemed to have been her fate that, during her
brief stay in our village, several young mothers
found themselves in mortal extremity. She
never lost a life. We think now with longing
of what she would have been among the
wounded. Alas! we were not destined to
keep such perfection with us. It was Cupid,
not death, that robbed us of this treasure&mdash;if
Cupid, indeed, it can be called, the dingy,
doubtful imp that took her away from her
wonderful work among us. Alas! charming,
devoted, exquisite being as she was, she had
a very human side. We fear there was a touch
of “pike,” as the old gardener had it, in the
business, but in spite of all our efforts a
“coloured gentleman,” an invalid to boot, a
shifty elderly fellow with an Oriental glibness
of tongue, carried her off away with him back
to India. She has since written to us describing
her palatial abode on the borders of a lake with
a horde of servants and a private steam-launch,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
but we strongly suspect that if the pen was the
pen of Nurse Dove, the words were the words
of the coloured gentleman.</p>

<p>The individual was a Baboo, a clerk in
the Madras Post Office, and had already
been invalided out of the service before he left
England. We cannot believe that the pension
of an underling in the Indian Civil Service runs
to these Rajah-like splendours. Moreover,
there was a tragic little postcard, sent to a
humble friend, which did not at all correspond
with the highflown letter above-mentioned:
“The world is a very sad place; we must all
be prepared for disappointments.”</p>

<p>There is one thing quite certain&mdash;wherever
she goes she will be doing good.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the second perfect nurse
resembled her in dark pallor of skin, splendour
of raven tresses, and thoughtful brilliance of
brown eyes; but she was younger and more
timid. She will want a few more years of
experience and self-reliance before she can
develop into a Nurse Dove.</p>

<p>But nevertheless, resembling her in countenance,
she had the same deep womanly heart
for her patients. Suffering in their sufferings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
she would spare no pains to relieve them. And
she had the touch of imaginative genius and
the courage to act on her own responsibility
which made her presence in a house of sickness
a comfort and a strength. In fact, the life was
to her a vocation. She nursed to help others,
not herself. She had not grown callous through
the sight of agonies, only more urgent to be
of use.</p>

<p>God send many such to our men in their need
to-day!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br />
“CONSIDER THE LILIES”</h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>“For the first time the Lamb shall be dyed red....”</p>

<p class="right"><i>Brother Johannes’ Prophecy.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p class="pfirst">“<span class="smcap">Consider</span> the lilies, how they grow....”</p>

<p>The sad thing is that with us they decline
to grow. When we bought the small, high-perched
house and grounds on the Surrey
hills there is no doubt that the thought of
lilies in those terraced gardens was no unimportant
part of the programme. Oddly, the
little house had from the first an Italian look,
which we have not been slow to cultivate.</p>

<p>Now we were haunted by a picture of an
Italian garden: a pergola&mdash;vine-covered, it was&mdash;with
two serried ranks of Madonna lilies
growing inside the arches; flagged as to pathway,
with probably fragrant tufts of mint and
thyme between the stones. In the land of its
conception this vision of shadowy green and
exquisite white, cool yet shining, as if snow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>-fashioned,
must have given upon some stretch
of quivering, heat-baked country.</p>

<p>Without being able to provide such an antithesis,
the garden-plotter&mdash;she means the
dreadful quip&mdash;otherwise the mistress of the
English Villino, with a vivid and charming picture
in her mind’s eye, fondly imaged a very
effective outlook upon the great shouldering
moors that rise startlingly across the narrow
valley at the bottom of her garden. But the
lilies refused to grow.</p>

<p>She tried them in border after border. She
set clumps of Auratums under the dining-room
between the heliotrope and the Nicotianas,
which swing such gushes of fragrance into
the little house all the hot summer days. She
got monster bulbs of Madonnas from the first
specialist in the kingdom, and put them singly
between the red and white roses against the
upper terrace wall. She ran amok upon
luscious spotted darlings; Pardelinum and
Monadelphum, Polyphyllum and Parryi, and
had them placed in a cool, shady walk against
a background of delphiniums. She thrust
Harrisi under the drawing-room bow; and the
glorious scarlet-trumpeted Thunbergianum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
where they would flame in the middle distance.
They showed many varied forms of disapproval,
but were unanimous in declining to remain
with us. Some were a little more polite than
the others. The great trumpets blew fiercely
for one season, almost as with a sound of
glorious brass, in their dim nook; and a single
exquisite, perfect stem of Krameri rose intact
amid a dying sisterhood, and swayed, delicately
proud, faintly flushed, a very princess among
flowers, one long, golden September fortnight.
But such meteors only make our persistent
gloom, where lilies are concerned, the more
signal.</p>

<p>The pergola had to go the way of so many
cherished dreams. Yet there is an exception.
With just an occasional threat of disease, there
is one border favoured by the tiger-lily. She
is not a very choice creature, of course; she
has neither the fragrance nor the mystic grace
of her cousins; but such as she is, she is
welcome in our midst. On our third terrace
there is a stretch of turf, curved outwards like
a half-moon, against a new yew hedge: we
call it the Hemicycle. In spring it is a jocund
pleasaunce for crocus and scylla and flowering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
trees&mdash;almond, <i>Pyrus floribunda</i>, and peach; in
summer the weeping standards hold the field,
set between the pots of climbing geraniums.
That is on the outward curve. A rough wall,
overhung with Dorothy Perkins, clothed from
the base with Rêve d’Or, runs straightly on the
inner side. It is in the border underneath this
wall that the tiger-ladies condescend to us.</p>

<p>Last year, by a somewhat accidental development
of seeds, we had a marvellous post-impressionist
effect along the line, for all the
stocks there planted, between the Tigrinum,
turned out to be purple and mauve. They
grew tall, with immense heads of bloom: drawn
up by the wall, we think. Over the orange
and violet row the Dorothy Perkins showered
masses of vivid pink. A narrow ribbon of
bright pale yellow violas ran between the
border and the turf. To connect this mass of
startling colour, an intermediate regiment of
lavender-bushes and the cream hues of the
Rêve d’Or roses against their grey-green foliage
acted very successfully. It is not a scheme
that one would perhaps have tried deliberately,
but we could not regret it. It does one good
sometimes to steep the senses in such a fine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
tangle of elementary colour. The shock is
bracing, as of a sea wave; like the march of
a military band, we could enjoy it, in the open
air and sunshine, just where it was placed;
away from the house, with its distant background
of fir-trees and moors.</p>

<p>Yet it is a mistake to use the word “post-impressionist”
in connection with our border;
for that movement, with all its pretended revival
of the old pagan spirit of joy, was only
an effort to conceal fundamental misery. The
tango is no dance of gods and nymphs, but a
dreadful merry-go-round of lost souls. The
post-impressionist painting is not a flag of
radiant defiance&mdash;youth challenging the unbelieved
gloom of life&mdash;but a kind of outbreak
as of disease: something spotty, fungoid, shaped
like germs under the microscope.</p>

<p>Let us come back to the lilies. Come out of
the fever-room into the garden.</p>

<p>We once tried to make a field of lilies. Our
lowest garden has a different kind of soil
fortunately from the greensand which makes
the upper terrace beds such rapacious devourers
of manure and fertilizers, and all the other
necessary and unfragrant riches. The Signora<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
took thought with herself and made a kind of
nursery plantation at one end of the vegetable
garden, to the meek despair of our gardener,
who, like all other gardeners, cherishes a
cabbage-patch with a passionate preference.
She invested in a good three thousand bulbs,
among others, hundreds of Candidums. Was
it a punishment for her extravagance? Many
years of life and experience have taught her
that where we sin we are punished, by as
inevitable a law as that of cause and effect. Or
was it just the cursed spite of those wandering
devils who, Indian and Irish folk alike believe,
are always hovering ready to pounce upon
success? Whether justice or malice, it is immaterial;
the result was disaster. They had
sent up straight spikes of vivid green, untouched
by a trace of the horrible bilious complexion
that bespeaks the prevalent disease,
when the May frost came and laid them flat
and seared.</p>

<p>After all, they would hardly have been much
use in that especial spot, as far as garden
perspective is concerned; and except for the
hall and staircase lilies are not indoor flowers.
The Signora loves the warm fragrance to gush<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
up diffused through the house, but in any
room it becomes overwhelming, almost gross.
She does not even care for them pictorially at
close quarters, meaning here the larger kind,
including Candidum. They are essentially
open-air flowers; they need the sun and the
wind about them, background and space. It
seems almost blasphemous to say so, but on
the nearer sight their appearance becomes like
their scent, a little coarse.</p>

<p>On an altar, once again, they assume their
proper proportions; and, carved in stone, they
are decorative and satisfying. But the Arum
lily, which is not a lily at all, long-stemmed, in
a vase, with its own gorgeous leaves about it,
is something to sit and gaze at with ever-increasing
content!</p>

<p>The nearest thing to a field of lilies the
Signora ever saw was a whole gardenful
at the back of a little house in Brussels. She
was only a child at the time, a weary, bored,
depressed small person at that, in the uncongenial
surroundings of a detested private
school. But one Sunday morning, for some
unremembered reason, she was taken after
Mass by the second mistress (an ugly, angry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
woman, inappropriately baptized Estelle), and
brought out of the dust of the scorching street
into this, to all appearance trivial, not to say
sordid, little house.</p>

<p>“Would Mademoiselle like to look at my
garden?” said its owner.</p>

<p>She was old and wizened and yellow-faced;
but she had kind eyes, and it was certainly a
kindly thought.</p>

<p>The whole of that garden, some forty by
twenty feet, was filled with Madonna lilies,
growing like grass in a field, with only a
narrow path whereby to walk round them.</p>

<p>“Consider the lilies how they grow....
Not Solomon in all his glory was arrayed as
one of these!”</p>

<p>The child that saw them was too unyeared
and ignorant to apply these wonderful words
if she had ever heard them. She could not
feel her pleasure sharpened by the exquisite
sensation of having the vision phrased in
language as beautiful as itself. But she has
carried away the memory, as sacredly as
Wordsworth that of his daffodils&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Wordsworth, notably among poets, has the
gift of expressing the inexpressible, of clothing
in language some fleeting sensation which
seems, of its exquisiteness and illusiveness,
undefinable. There are lines of his that follow
one like a phrase of music.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The sounding cataract haunted me like a passion.”</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... Old, unhappy, far-off things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And battles long ago.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first effect of any sight of surpassing
beauty, indeed of any strong emotion of admiration,
is an instant desire of expression; then
comes the pain of inarticulateness to most of us&mdash;there
is a swelling of the soul and no outlet!
That is why, when someone else may have
perfectly said what for us is inexpressible,
there is a double joy in discoveries.</p>

<p>To wander from our lilies to flowers of
speech and description: the perfect phrase has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
in itself a delight that almost equals that of the
perfect thought.</p>

<p>For those who, like ourselves, work in words,
however humbly&mdash;poor stone-breakers compared
to such as make the marble live&mdash;the
mere art in the setting of the words themselves
has a fascination of its own. It is
not only the idea&mdash;it is sometimes not even
the idea that enchants. There is a magic
of cadence alone. Sometimes, indeed, just
a conjunction of two words seems to make
a chord.</p>

<p>To go further, a single word may ring out
like a note upon the mind. The Italian <i>Amore</i>,
for instance&mdash;who can deny that it echoes richly
and nobly? It is a sound of gravity and
passion mixed. It is like the first vibrating
stroke of a master-hand on the ’cello. Did not
the resonance of the word itself go as far
as the meaning to inspire Jacopone with his
ecstatic hymn wherein he plays upon it like
a musician upon a note which calls, insists,
repeats itself, for ever dominates or haunts the
theme?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Amore, amore, che si m’hai ferito</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Altro che amore non posso gridare:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amore, amore, teco so unito....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">You could not take the word “love” and ring
the changes in this way, not even upon the
kindred-sounding <i>Amour</i>, losing in its “ou”
exactly the tone of solemnity that makes the
Italian equivalent so royal.</p>

<p>In a delightful series of musical sketches
recently published, the author remarks, speaking
of Tschaikowski’s “Symphonie Pathétique”:</p>

<p>“For those who have the score there is an
added joy in the titles, ‘Incalzando,’ ‘feroce,’
‘affretando,’ ‘saltando,’ ‘con dolcezza e flebile,’
‘con tenerezza e devozione’; it makes most
interesting reading. But the most splendid
title of all is that of the last movement, ‘Adagio
Lamentoso’&mdash;can’t you hear it? What a lot
our language misses by the clipped and oxytone
‘lament’! Even ‘lamentation’ is a mere shadow
beside the full roll of the Latin tongues, the
ineffable melody that sounds in ‘lamentabile
regnum.’”</p>

<p>We do not, however, agree with this pleasant
writer on the subject of “clipped and oxytone
lament.” To us the English word is infinitely
keener reaching than any added vowel could
make it! “Lamentable” we grant to be pompous
and middle Victorian. It is eloquent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span>
the conventional mourning of the funeral mute,
while <i>lamentoso</i> has to our ear a horrible wobble
like the howl of a lonely dog.</p>

<p>We defy the most poetical and profound
scholar to render in any other tongue the <i>guai</i>
of Dante. Who could give the value of the
hopeless cry of sorrow culminating in that line
of which <i>guai</i> is the central wail!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Cosi vid’ io venir, traendo guai</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ombre portate della detta briga.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not to insist on the obvious that
Italian is a musical language and Dante a star
apart. Every language that has served literature
will be found to hold its own words of
magic. It is not the moment to quote German,
but we think <i>Trauer</i> tolls across the senses like
the passing-bell, while the French <i>Glas</i> falls
upon the soul with a frozen misery indescribable
outside itself.</p>

<p>Those fortunate scholars who have mastered
as much of the secrets of Greek as the modern
can master, tell us that it is impossible to
convey in any other tongue the richness, the
value, the wide meaning and exquisite shades
of the ancient Greek language. We know that
they had words in each of which a whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
picture could be set before the mind. To read
Gilbert Murray’s fascinating “Ancient Greek
Literature” is, however, to find a revelation
which severer and more extensive writings
fail to convey. A poet, he alone has caught
and interpreted the echo of those lyres still
ringing across the ages. And he, too, computes
his impressions in terms of music. “Many
lovers of Pindar,” he says, “agree that the
things which stay in one’s mind, stay not as
thoughts but as music.”</p>

<p>Of course, the Greeks wedded words and
music after a fashion unknown to us, who
merely set words to be sung to music in our
operas and songs. It is a lost art.</p>

<p>But it seems conceivable that there may be
an actual music hidden in language itself, something
that the senses of the mind apprehend,
quite apart from the idea incorporated. The
late Sir Henry Irving, just before his famous
production of Macbeth, discussing his intention
of introducing music at the moments of crisis,
defended this much criticized point by saying:
“I mean to do it, because music carries the
soul beyond words, even beyond thought.”</p>

<p>We are not sure that he was right, except in so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
far as the appeal to the gallery was concerned,
which, after all, every actor-manager, however
artistic and perceptive, is bound to consider
first of all. In fact, we are quite certain that
he was wrong. The music of Shakespeare
should not have been overlaid by any sound
of violin or trumpet.</p>

<p>We can conceive no sorrow of muted strings
which could intensify the poignancy of Macduff’s
cry: “All my pretty ones, did you say all?” A
cry, too, so spontaneous in its truth and simplicity
that, according to a current phrase in
the theatrical profession, the part of Macduff
acts itself.</p>

<p>Who would want to add more melody to the
following</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“That strain again&mdash;it had a dying fall:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet south</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That breathes upon a bank of violets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stealing, and giving odour....”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Will anyone deny that there is music in these
lines, that the singular impression produced by
them is due not only to the perfection of a
thought perfectly expressed, to the scent of
violets exquisitely and instantly evoked by the
cunning of genius, but to the actual words?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
The phrase rises and falls. Read or heard,
it is the same, a strain of melody.</p>

<p>To one of the writers the two words,
“Scarlet Verbena,” have always produced the
impression as of a trumpet blast. Hoffmann
used to say that he never smelt a red carnation
without hearing the winding of a horn.</p>

<p>No doubt the senses are indefinably intermixed.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wild bird, whose warble, liquid sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rings Eden thro’ the budded quicks,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">O tell me where the passions meet”&mdash;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">cries Tennyson to the nightingale.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, must one not believe that there
are distinct senses of the soul and mind which
are called into action by the spoken or written
word? It is trite to say there are moments
when one is gripped by the throat by a mere
phrase, not, mind you, because of its dramatic
force, but rather from some inherent spell of
beauty or sorrow. There are others when one
seems to lay hold of a set of words; as it were,
to be able to touch and feel them as though
they had been modelled.</p>

<p>And again, who has not felt an actual pain, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
of a delicate blade being thrust into the heart,
by some phrase of scarcely analyzable pathos.
Heine had that weapon. The art of it, we
suppose, is that of extreme simplicity combined
with selection, but the emotion is quite incommensurate
with the importance of the theme,
the value of the expressed idea.</p>

<p>To use another simile, it is like a wailing air
on some primitive instrument, which by its
very artlessness pierces to the marrow of the
consciousness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ces doux airs du pays, au doux rythme obsesseur,</div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">as Rostand has it.</p>

<p>Think of the effect in “Tristran” of the
shepherd’s pipe at the beginning of the last
act.</p>

<p>It comes to this after all, that however one
may study, however perfect the technique of
writing, however one may inspire oneself from
the springs of genius, it is artlessness, not art,
that reaches home. It might be truer to say that
it takes a consummate art to touch the right note
of artlessness; yet we all know how curiously
we can sometimes be affected by the words
that fall from childish lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>A Belgian babe of two, a dimpled, radiant
creature, seemingly untouched by the storm
which had flung her from her own luxurious
nurseries into a bare English lodging, was
found, two days after her arrival in exile, kissing
and talking to the little crucifix which
hung round her neck. Her mother bent to
listen.</p>

<p>“Dear Jesus,” the child was saying, “poor
wounded soldier!”</p>

<p>The profound and mystic consolation of the
link between the human agony and the Divine
had somehow dawned upon the infant mind,
and found this tender expression.</p>

<p>A little boy we knew said to his mother one
evening as she tucked him up in his cot:</p>

<p>“Oh, mammie, I die a little every night,
I love you so.” Here, with an exquisite directness,
the inevitable pain of a deep tenderness
is laid bare by the lips of innocence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is this quality of simplicity and directness&mdash;yes,
we are not afraid to say it, of innocence&mdash;which
makes the stories of our soldiers so
infinitely touching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Tell daddie and mammie,” said a dying
Irish lad to the comrade who bent over him
to take his last message, “’twas against their
will I ’listed; tell them I’m not sorry now I
did it.”</p>

<p>No fine-sounding phrase, no stirring oration,
could more piercingly set forth the triumph of
the ultimate sacrifice of patriotism. <i>Dulce et
decorum est pro patria mori.</i></p>

<p>Our men are like children in their gaiety&mdash;pleased
with little things as a child with a toy;
joking, making believe, making a game out of
their very danger; unconscious of their own
heroism, as the best kind of boy, who risks his
neck for a nest; blindly confident in their
leaders. If it had not been for this complete
trust in what their officers told them, could the
retreat from Mons have ended in anything but
disaster? Yet we know that&mdash;like children&mdash;whole
regiments burst into tears when ordered
to give up the positions they had won.</p>

<p>A war correspondent ends a terrible account
of the further withdrawal from Tournai by a
description of a night in a barn where scatterers
had taken refuge.</p>

<p>“And all night long,” he says, “there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
the sobs of a big corporal of artillery, weeping
for his horses.”</p>

<p>In the throes of the great struggle, this side
of humanity&mdash;call it the childish, if you will, we
have Divine authority for believing that it is
akin to the spiritual&mdash;asserts itself, nay, becomes
paramount. To be more precise, the
real man is stripped of his conventions, sophistries,
and pretences. Only the things that
matter are the things that count.</p>

<p>When the Emperor Frederick was dying, his
last message was this: “Let my people return
to their faith and simplicity of life.”</p>

<p>If he had been spared to his own land, it
would be a different world to-day. Under the
dreadful test of war the German soldiery as a
mass, indeed the whole people, have sunk
below the level of the brute. It is the English
who have come back to faith and simplicity.</p>

<p>The Rev. W. Forest, Catholic Chaplain of
the Expeditionary Force, writes: “It is true to
say that the German Kaiser is fighting a community
of saints&mdash;converted, if you like&mdash;but
with not a mortal sin scarcely to be found
among them.” The special correspondent of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
the <i>Sunday Times</i> has a touching testimony in
a recent issue to men of all denominations:
“To be at the front,” he declares, “is to breathe
the air of heroes. The Church of England
chaplains, in accordance with the general wish
among the men, are giving Early Communion
Services. It is a marvellous sight,” continues
the journalist, “to see the throngs of soldiers
kneeling in the dawn, the light on their upturned
faces. They go forth strengthened,
ready for anything, feeling that the presence of
Christ is amongst them.”</p>

<p>With our French Allies, too, the spirit of
faith has reawakened. An English officer
writes to the <i>Evening Standard</i>: “The French
soldiers go into the trenches, each with his
little medal of Our Lady hung round his neck&mdash;they
pray aloud in action, not in fear, but
with a high courage and a great trust.”</p>

<p>“On All Souls’ Day,” he adds, “I saw the
village <i>curé</i> come out and bless the graves of
our poor lads. The graves, mark, of rough
Protestant soldiers, decorated with chrysanthemums
by the villagers. These poor dead
were blessed, and called the faithful departed,
and wept over and prayed for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“And thine own soul a sword shall pierce,
that out of many hearts thoughts may be
revealed.”</p>

<p>If one may reverently paraphrase Simeon’s
prophecy to the mother of the Man of Sorrows,
can one not say that the soul of the world
is pierced to-day, and the thoughts of the
nations revealed?</p>

<p>A neutral diplomat, recently arrived in
England from Vienna, via Paris, has told us
of the singular indifference of the Austrian
capital to the tragedy in which her own sons
are taking part. “Vienna,” he says, “has
shown only one moment of emotion, and that
was when the little breakfast rolls were condemned.
No one cares in Vienna. Life is&mdash;how
shall I say?&mdash;it is all one ‘Merry Widow.’
It is not that they have any confidence in their
own army. They shrug their shoulders and
spread out their hands, but in Germany&mdash;they
have the faith of the hypnotized! Nothing
can happen to Germany, therefore Austria is
safe.”</p>

<p>Recently an order was issued to have the
cafés closed at one o’clock in the morning. It
was not agreeable to the public, but they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
contrived a substitute for their <i>petits pains</i>
which is some slight compensation.</p>

<p>“I shall return,” he added pensively&mdash;“I shall
return with how much regret to the indecent
carnival that is Vienna!”</p>

<p>His impression of France was very different.
He could not sufficiently express his astonishment
at the change that had come over the
country. The dignity of France, the quiet
strength of France, the spiritual confidence of
France! In the army was only one apprehension:
lest they should not be upheld by
the civilians in their determination to fight to
the very end. The churches were crowded; men
and women have alike returned to the faith of
their fathers. There was no unseemly merrymaking
there, no unworthy attempt in café or
theatre to forget the agonizing struggle.</p>

<p>At a recent entertainment in a very poor
quarter a pretty girl dressed as France appeared
arm-in-arm with an actor got up like a British
soldier, and there was immense applause; but
when she started the tango with her companion
she was hissed off the stage.</p>

<p>As for Paris: “Tenez,” said our friend, in
conclusion, “I will give you a little instance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
I was walking down the Rue de la Paix, when
I heard a woman laugh out loud. Everyone in
the street turned round to look at her.”</p>

<p>Of the thoughts of Germany what can be
said? They need no pointing out. They are
written in blood and fire from end to end of
Belgium, and in a long stretch of once smiling
France; in Servia, carried out by Hungarians
and Austrians, under German orders; in
Poland. They are written in the German
Press for all the world to read: blasphemy,
brag, bluster, hysterical hatred, insanity of
futile threat, shameless asseveration of self-evident
falsehood. “Do nations go mad?”
an American paper has asked. Germany
presents the appalling spectacle of a nation
run to evil. It is not only the war party, the
soldiery, the press, the learned professors. It
is the very population itself. The soul of
Germany is revealing its thoughts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The lily-garden in the little Brussels by-street
on the way to the Bois de la Cambre, if
it is still in existence, must have ceased blooming
before the Germans entered Brussels.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
Otherwise it is not likely that it should have
escaped the fury of destruction which seizes
them at the sight of anything pure and noble
and beautiful.</p>

<p>“Consider the lilies.”</p>

<p>We know how the Uhlan officers deliberately
rode backwards and forwards over the blooming
flower-beds in the great <i>Place</i> upon the
day of their entrance march.</p>

<p>We know how they stabled their horses in
the world-famous conservatories of the Palace
of Laecken&mdash;a custom they have practised at
nearly every château in the country; how in
that orgy which will for ever disgrace the name
of the Duke of Brunswick the portrait of the
young Queen of the Belgians, that royal flower
of courage and devotion, was unspeakably insulted.</p>

<p>We know how whole regiments have trampled
over straggling children in the village streets&mdash;these
little flower blossoms, as the Japanese
call them.</p>

<p>And those humble lilies of the cloister that
have fallen into sacrilegious grasp, we know
how they have been considered; how Rheims,
with its hawthorn porch, blossoming in stone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
flower of all the Christian shrines of all the
world, stately lily of the days of faith, has
fared at the hand of the German.</p>

<p>“<i>Ich bin der Geist der stets verneint</i>,” says the
Spirit of Evil in Goethe’s “Faust.”</p>

<p>It has always seemed a marvellous definition;
the negation of good, the spirit that ever denies.
But the demon of present-day Germany comes
from a deeper pit than Goethe’s intellectual
mocking devil. It is the spirit that forever
destroys.</p>

<p>The struggle has not brutalized but spiritualized
our men. Through the appalling conditions
in which they fight they reach out to the
mystic side of things. When they speak of
death they call it “going west.” It is the old,
old Celtic thought of the Isle beyond the Sunset.
They “talk of God a great deal,” as the soldiers’
letters tell us. The Irish Guards fell on
their knees at Compiègne before making their
famous attack up the hill. As they charged,
“our men crossed the plain, hurrahing and
singing, while many of them had a look of
absolute joy on their faces.” They have their
visions. A soldier lying wounded and helpless
on the field and gazing agonized on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span>
breach in our line, saw the Germans rush and
then fall back; and beheld St. George standing
in his armour in the gap; then heard the Lancastrians
cry, as they dashed on: “St. George
for England!”</p>

<p>What yet more august revelation did he
have, that dying French sergeant, who, looking
profoundly upon the surgeon who was ministering
to him, replied to his encouragement:</p>

<p>“Mon Major, je suis déjà avec Dieu,” and
instantly expired.</p>

<p>Every regiment must have its emblem; the
minds of the men turn naturally to the symbolic.</p>

<p>“I’d like to look at the colours,” said a
mortally wounded gunner to his Captain.</p>

<p>“Look at the guns, my man, those are the
gunners’ colours!”</p>

<p>And the boy was uplifted to look, till his eye
glazed.</p>

<p>We do not take the colours into action now,
but we know what the Standard means to our
Allies. It seems a pity that political revolution
should have displaced the ancient lilies of
France. There is something so grand in tradition.
Dignity of noble ancestry is not confined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
to man alone. Houses possess it, and lands,
and surely nations. Are not our soldiers to-day
the heirs of the yeomen and bowmen of
Agincourt?</p>

<p>“O God of battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts!”
is the prayer on the lips of all of us; and we feel
through all, even as Harry the King, the same
proud confidence in the good blood that cannot
lie. Shall not those who stay at home “hold
their manhoods cheap, whiles any speaks” of
Mons, or Ypres, or&mdash;of those glories yet to
come?</p>

<p>Thus, in a way, it seems to us that if France
fights in her body under the Tricolour, in her
soul she is fighting under the Lilies. It is the
old France again, the France of the days of
faith. In one of Joan of Arc’s visions she saw
Charlemagne and St. Louis kneeling before the
throne, pleading for the land they had loved
and served. She who carried the Oriflamme
may now form the third in that shining company
and look down, perhaps, considering the
lilies growing out of the field of blood. Perhaps
she may say: “Not Solomon in all his glory
was arrayed as one of these.”</p>

DEATH IN THE LITTLE GARDEN</h2>

</div>

<p class="pfirst"><i><span class="smcap">March</span>.</i>&mdash;We bought the small place on the
Surrey highlands and furnished it out of Rome;
and set statues and cypresses and vases overflowing
with flowers about the quaint terraces
that run down to the valley; and we have a bit
of Italy between pine-woods and wild moorland.
We have called it the Villino.</p>

<p>The idea started as a week-end cottage.
Gradually, however, we came to pay the flying
visits to the London house and spend the most
of our time in the country. Since the war
began we have settled altogether on the span
of earth which has become so endeared to us.
Never was any home established in such a
spirit of lightheartedness.</p>

<p>The new property has been our toy; something
to laugh at while we enjoy it. It is absurd
and apart and beloved and attractive; and though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
the great shadow that rose in August overcast
the brightness of the Villino garden and all its
prospects, we could yet look out upon the
peace and the fairness and take comfort therefrom;
turn with relief to the growing things
and all the innocent interests that surround
and centre in a country life.</p>

<p>It never dawned upon us that the garden
itself could become a point of tragedy; that
every pushing spike of bulb and every well-pruned
rose-tree would have their special pang
for our hearts, yet so it is. Never again shall we
be able to look with the eyes of pure enjoyment
on terrace and border, rose-arch and woodland.</p>

<p>Adam, the kindly gardener of our special
plot of earth, has been struck down; hurled,
by an inscrutable decree of Providence in the
zenith of his activities, from life to death.</p>

<p>He was as much a part of the Villino as we
ourselves; a just and kindly man, not yet forty;
one of the handsomest of God’s creatures, and the
most gentle-hearted. We cannot see the meaning
of such a blow; we can only bow the head.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it seem hard,” cried the daughter
of the Villino, “that in these days there should
be one unnecessary widow!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>The last time the Signora saw him alive
was about a week before the tragedy. He
had come into the funny little Roman drawing-room&mdash;all
faint gay tints and flamboyant Italian
gilt carved wood&mdash;carrying a large pot of arum
lilies. He scarcely looked like an Englishman
with his dark, rich colouring and raven hair
prematurely grey; though he was so all-English,
of England’s best, in his heart and mind.</p>

<p>A little Belgian child, on a visit to us,
rushed up to him, chattering incomprehensibly.
She is just three and very friendly; something
in Adam’s appearance must have attracted her,
for she left everything she had been playing
with to run to him the moment he appeared.</p>

<p>This is how the Signora will always remember
him, standing, big and gentle, looking down
at the child with those kind, kind eyes.</p>

<p>There was never anyone so good to little
animals. We used to say he was a true if
unconscious brother of St. Francis, and loved
all God’s small folk. Never was a sick cat or
dog but Adam would have the nursing of it.</p>

<p>One would see him walking about the garden
wheeling his barrow, with a great black Persian
coiled round his neck like a boa. Nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
years ago a little daughter was born to him
here, to his great joy. She was always in her
father’s arms during the free hours of the day;
and not the least piteous incident of the tragedy
was the way this baby, just beginning to babble
a few words, kept calling for “Daddy, daddy,”
while he lay next door in the tiny sitting-room
he had taken such pleasure in, like a marble
effigy, smiling, beautiful, awful, for ever deaf
to her appeal.</p>

<p>He had been slightly ailing since an attack
of influenza; but on the morning of his death
he said to his wife that he felt as if he could
do the work of six men that day. The kind of
cruel light-heartedness which the Scotch call
“being fey” was upon him. Like Romeo
before the great catastrophe, “his bosom’s
lord sat lightly on his throne.” Strange freaks
of presentiment never to be explained on this
side of the grave! There are those who feel
the shadow of approaching fatality cloud their
spirits&mdash;we have heard a hundred instances
of certain forebodings of death during the
present war&mdash;but this mysterious gaiety of
the doomed is rarer and more awful. Yet
Adam must have had his secret sad warnings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
too, for his poor wife found, to her astonishment,
his insurance cards, his accounts made
up to the end of the week on the Thursday of
which he died, the ambulance badge he had
been so proud of&mdash;all laid ready to her hand.
He had set his house in order before the
summons came. We have every reason to
think that in a deeper, graver sense he was
equally prepared.</p>

<p>“‘Whatever time my Saviour calls me, I shall
be ready to go....’ Often and often,” Mrs.
Adam told us, as her tears fell, “he has said
those words to me.”</p>

<p>Like many another active, hard-working man,
the thought of failing health, debility, old age,
was abhorrent to him.</p>

<p>“He never could have borne a long illness.”
Thus the widow tries to console herself&mdash;pitiful
scraps of self-administered comfort with which
poor humanity always attempts to parry the
horror of an unmitigated tragedy!</p>

<p>There are strange secrets between the soul
and God. Among the many wonders of the
City of Light will be the simple solving of the
riddles that have been so dark and tormenting
to our earthly minds. From the very beginning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
of the war this honest Englishman had wanted
to go out and serve his country. He was over
age. His wife and two children depended on
his labours, yet the longing never left him.</p>

<p>“I doubt but I’ll have to go yet,” was a
phrase constantly on his lips.</p>

<p>He had joined the Ambulance Corps and,
indeed, was on his way to that errand of mercy
when he was stricken. Did he in those inner
communes of the soul with God breathe forth
his desire to give his life for his country, and
was it somehow mystically accomplished? For
death smote him and he fell and lay in his blood,
as a soldier might. Who knows that the sacrifice
was not accepted?</p>

<p>It was terrible for us&mdash;it seemed an unbelievable
addition to her burthen of sorrow
for the woman who loved him&mdash;but for him it
may have been the glory and the crown.</p>

<p>When all human aid is unavailing, when
everything that science can do to assist or
relieve has been accomplished and fellow-creatures
must stand aside and watch the
relentless law of nature accomplish itself, then
the value of religion is felt, as perhaps never
before, even by the most devout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Had poor Adam but belonged to the Old
Faith the call for the priest would have been
more urgent yet than the call for the doctor;
we would have had the consolation of hearing
the last Absolution pronounced over the unconscious
form. The soul would have taken
flight from the anointed body, strengthened
by the ultimate rites; the child of the Church
would have gone forth from the arms of the
Church&mdash;from the arms of the earthly mother,
to the mercy and justice of the heavenly Father.</p>

<p>We did what we could, his own clergyman
being away. Never were we more impressed
with the value of the Sacrament of Extreme
Unction. It is all very well to say that we
must live so as to be ready to die; that as the
tree grows so shall it fall. Here are trite
axioms that will not stand a moment before
the facts of life and the needs of humanity.
They make no account of the mercy of the
Creator on one side nor of the weakness of the
failing spirit on the other. They forget the
penitent thief on the cross, bidden to enter
into Paradise upon the merit of a single cry. If
the Church of our ancestors watches anxiously
over the whole existence of her children; if she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
hovers about the cradle, how does she not hang
over the deathbed to catch the faintest sigh of
repentance; nay, how does she not “prevent”
the least effort, pouring forth graces and supplications,
anointing, absolving, pursuing the
departing spirit beyond the very confines of
the world, sublimely audacious, to the throne
of God itself!</p>

<p>She has caught the precious soul, for whom
the Lord died, before the infant mind was even
aware of its own existence. She is not going
to be robbed of her treasure at the end, if she
can help it.</p>

<p>But our poor, dying Adam was not of this
fold, and could have no such aid and sanctification
for his passing. Even his afflicted wife
quailed from the fruitless agony of witnessing
his last moments. “Since I couldn’t do anything,
ma’am, it’s more than I can bear.”</p>

<p>She went down to her cottage at the bottom
of the garden to prepare a fit resting-place for
the body, while in the garage the soul of her
dearest accomplished its final and supreme act
on earth.</p>

<p>We read the great prayers to ourselves&mdash;those
wonderful prayers commensurate in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
dignity and grandeur to the awful moment.
We cried upon the Angels and Archangels,
upon the Thrones, the Cherubim and Seraphim;
we bade the Patriarchs and the Prophets, the
Doctors and Evangelists, the Confessors and
Martyrs, the Holy Virgins and all the Saints
of God to rush to his assistance. We supplicated
that his place this day should be in peace
and his abode in Holy Sion; we cast his sins
upon the multitudes of the Divine mercies, and
strong through the merits of Christ our appeal
rose into triumph. With confidence we summoned
the noble company of the Angels to
meet him, the court of the Apostles to receive
him, the army of glorious Martyrs to conduct
him, the joyful Confessors to encompass him,
the choir of blessed Virgins to go before him.
We conjured Christ, his Saviour, to appear to
him with a mild and cheerful countenance.
And, with this great name upon our lips, we
“compassed him about with angels, so that the
infernal spirits should tremble and retire into
the horrid confusion of eternal night.”</p>

<p>All the household, except the very young
servants, knelt round him praying silently,
since we did not dare obtrude our own tenets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
about the deathbed of another faith. The
Master stood with his hand on his dying
servant’s head; and so the end came very
peacefully.</p>

<p>A belated curate appeared at the cottage as
the daughter of the house went down to tell
Mrs. Adam that all was over; but he fled
before the sad burthen was carried in.</p>

<p>We had often noticed it before, but never so
forcibly, this shying away of some excellent
religious people from any contemplation of the
immediate experience of the soul after death.
Beyond sentences of comfort as stereotyped as
they are vague, which place the departed “safe
in the arms of Jesus,” one would almost believe
that the average man had no very vivid sense
of the future life at all. How otherwise explain
the remarks, so frequently heard, that a sudden
death is such a desirable end; that it was “such
a comfort so-and-so didn’t know he was going”;
how explain the attitude at the sick-bed, where
the sufferer to the last is deluded with false
hopes that he may be spared&mdash;what? the knowledge
that he is summoned to the house of God,
the last opportunity of preparation.</p>

<p>Even when Mrs. Adam’s clergyman came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>
see her, chief among his consolations was the
remark, made in all sincerity: “That’s the kind
of death I should prefer to die.”</p>

<p>Good Adam was ready to go, we know that;
but can any man with a true sense of his own
soul bring himself to wish to be taken in like
manner? It is, after all, to wish for one’s self
the death one would want for one’s dog. Without
even belonging to a Church where the last
stage is hallowed and made a culminating act
of precious resignation and the highest virtue,
it seems to us that the instinctive nobility of
man should rebel against the craven doctrine
that death is a thing to be huddled through, a
step to be taken drugged and blindfolded, that
the consciousness is to be chloroformed against
the anguish of dissolution. It is to rob
humanity of its supremest quality&mdash;the triumph
of the spirit over the flesh, the noble acceptance
of our lot, the dignity of the last renunciation.</p>

<p>Browning, the most virile of our poets, cries:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I was ever a fighter, so&mdash;one fight more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The best and the last!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I would hate that death bandaged my eyes and forebore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And bade me creep past.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No! let me taste the whole of it, fare like my peers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The heroes of old.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span></p>
<p>Yet this curious evasion of the inevitable is
only the natural outcome of a looseness of
theology which, while it admits the dogma of
right and wrong, of free will and human responsibility,
hurls the perfect and the imperfect,
the saint and the sinner alike, into the same
heaven without an instant’s transition. As
very few now believe in hell, it is no unfair
conclusion to draw that the mere fact of death
seems, in the eyes of most people, to qualify
the soul for eternal bliss. It is idle to ask what
becomes of the generally accepted doctrine of
moral responsibility, why, if all are alike and
certain to be saved, anyone should put himself
to the disagreeable task of resisting temptation,
much less strive after perfection here below;
but failure to provide help for the dying is the
direct consequence of the denial of future
expiation.</p>

<p>“What man is there among you who, if his
son shall ask bread, will he reach him a
stone?”</p>

<p>The Viaticum, the bread of life, is denied to
the passing soul, and the draught of comfort of
devout prayer withheld from the beloved in
the fires of expiation; but the tombstone will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
be considered with loving thought, and erected
over the insensible dust.</p>

<p>The Old Faith shows a profound knowledge
of and tenderness for the mere human side in its
hour of anguish, even while providing for the
paramount needs of the soul. There is one,
one only comfort for the bereaved&mdash;to be able
to help still, and of that they are deprived.</p>

<p>“It isn’t as if I could do any good,” said poor
Mrs. Adam, when she turned away from her
husband’s deathbed.</p>

<p>She had the power to do such infinite good if
she had only known it. What prayer could be
so far-reaching as that of the cry of the wife for
the chosen one, from whom God alone reserved
Himself the right to part her? What act of
resignation could be so meritorious as that of
her who was making the sacrifice of her all?</p>

<p>“I sent down to tell them to ring the passing-bell,”
said the widow. She was eager to accomplish
every detail of respectful ceremony
that had been left to her.</p>

<p>The passing-bell! Touching institution of
the ages of belief, the call for prayers for the
soul in its last struggle, the summons to friend
and stranger, kindly neighbour and stray<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
passer-by, the cry of the mother for the last
alms for her child!</p>

<p>“Oh,” exclaimed our daughter that night,
reflecting on these things, “my heart burns
when I think how the poor have been robbed
of their faith!”</p>

<p>And the mighty lesson which the ancient
Church taught by her attitude to the dying is
that by calmly turning the eyes of the faithful
towards the need for preparation, the duty of
warning the sick in time, the immeasurable
gain of the last Sacraments as compared to the
loss of an unfounded earthly hope, she is giving
the only possible comfort alike to the living
and the dying; she is placing within reach of
the mourners just the one factor that makes
their grief bearable&mdash;the power of being of use.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacComfort, our Irish cook, who is as
near a saint herself as one can ever hope to
meet, said to us, the tears brimming in her soft
eyes: “Oh, doesn’t it make us feel ashamed of
ourselves when we see what our holy religion
is, and how little we live up to it!”</p>

<p>And, indeed, that our poor fellow-countrymen
are so good without these helps is at once a
wonder and a rebuke to us. Mrs. Adam made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span>
her sacrifice with a most touching submission:
“God must know best.”</p>

<p>“When they came down and told me there’d
been an accident, my hands were in the washtub,
miss,” she told one of us later, “and as I
ran up the garden drying them in my apron,
I was praying God all the while that he would
give me strength to bear what I might have to
see.”</p>

<p>God never refuses such a prayer as that.
Adam was an example. It is astonishing the
effect the death of this simple gardener has
made in the district, and the testimonies of his
worth keep coming in. It shows how wide the
influence one good man can exercise in any
class of life&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The very ashes of the just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Smell sweet and blossom in the dust.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a narrower sense we shall ourselves
always feel that something of him has gone
into the soil of our little garden, for which he
worked so faithfully. Some of the fragrance
of that humble soul will rise up from the violet
beds and hang about the roses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have been the more disposed to draw
these parallels between the Old Faith and its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span>
substitute because, by a curious coincidence,
Adam’s was the second death to fling sadness
over the Villino.</p>

<p>The first was not a personal loss, like that
of a servant in the house. It concerned, indeed,
a being whom only one of us had seen. It
happened far away in the bloody swamps of
the Yser; yet, none the less, the tidings filled
the little household with mourning.</p>

<p>Among the many exiles flying to our shores
from the horror of the advancing Hun were
two young mothers with their children&mdash;two
charming, delicately nurtured, high-born, high-minded
women, whose husbands were, one, an
officer in the Belgian army, the other, a volunteer
working in the ambulance at Calais. The
soldier’s wife, the niece of an old friend of ours,
a gay, courageous creature, who twice had gone
into the line of fire to see her husband, was
never tired of speaking to us of “Charley.” He
seemed in the end to have become almost a
familiar among us. We knew by his photographs
that he was handsome, and, by the
portions of his letters which she read to us,
that he was tender and deep-feeling and strong
of courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>Some weeks ago Charley’s wife left to live
with her sister; her cousin still remained with
us. It was the latter who was sent for to the
telephone that evening when the shadow of
death rolled up suddenly and hung over the
little house.</p>

<p>An unforgettable moment when she turned
from the instrument, crying in accents that
pierced one: “<i>Charley tué! Mon Dieu, mon
Dieu, Charley tué!</i>”</p>

<p>It was when we afterwards learnt the details
of the tragedy, which were piteous in the
extreme as far as it affected the wife, that the
noble consolations of our religion emerged in
all their beauty.</p>

<p>The officer had announced an approaching
leave, and the joyful anticipation of his little
family was commensurate to the love they bore
him. As one instance of that love, let it be
noted here that his small son, only six years
old, could never hear the name of his absent
father without tears.</p>

<p>The wife was alone in the garden, resting
from the fatigues of a morning spent in preparing
for that visit, when a telegram arrived,
badly transcribed, in French. She could at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
first only make out her husband’s name, her
brother’s signature, and the words, “Shall be
at Calais to-day.”</p>

<p>She danced into the house in ecstasy, crying
to the children: “Papa is coming; papa and
Uncle Robert are coming.”</p>

<p>And it was only on the stairs that a second
glance at the sheet in her hand revealed the
fatal word “<i>tué</i>.”</p>

<p>A cousin&mdash;another young exiled wife and
mother&mdash;who lived in close proximity, was
summoned by the distracted maid, and writes
in simple language of the scene of agony: “As
soon as I got into the little house,” she says,
“I heard her dreadful sobs; I ran to her.
‘Charley is killed, Charley is killed!’ she cried
to me. I have never seen anyone in such a
state. She was almost in convulsions. I put
my arms about her. ‘Make your sacrifice;
offer it up for the good of his soul,’ I said to
her. ‘No, no! I cannot,’ she said. At first
she could not, but I held her close, and after
a little I said to her: ‘Say the words after me:
“O my God, I accept your will for the good of
his soul.”’ And once she had said it she did not
go back on it. From that moment she was calm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>So calm, indeed, that the unhappy young
creature had the strength of mind to go in to
her children, terrified at the sound of her
weeping, and smilingly reassure them, talk
and play with them, till their bedtime. She
meant to start that night for Calais, and did
not wish her little ones to know of their loss
till her return.</p>

<p>All her energies were strained to the single
purpose&mdash;to see him once again before he was
laid to rest. She had her desire. The journey
was an odyssey of physical and mental pain,
but by sheer determination she won through,
and found her brother, who had obtained leave
of absence from his regiment to meet her. By
him she was conveyed to a little village at the
back of the Belgian line, where, in a chapel
belonging to a convent, the dead man lay.</p>

<p>It had been his last day in the trenches. The
next was to begin his brief holiday. He had
been posted in that celebrated Maison du
Passeur, among the slimy waters, destined to
be the scene of one more tragedy. There was
an alarm that certain enemy snipers were
lurking about, and a small patrol had been
ordered to take stock of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“I will not,” said the young officer, “allow
my men to go into danger without me.”</p>

<p>It was not his duty&mdash;it was scarcely even
advisable&mdash;but he took up a soldier’s carbine
and went forth with it. He was actually taking
aim when the sergeant beside him saw him fail
and slowly collapse. There was, perhaps, a
noise of cannon to confuse the man’s senses,
for he heard no shot. There was certainly no
start or shock apparent. He called out: “<i>Mon
lieutenant, qu’avez vous?</i>” believing it was a
sudden attack of weakness. When he went to
his lieutenant he found that he was dead. He
had been struck by a bullet under the eye, so
well and truly aimed that it had instantly
ended the young, vigorous life, as far as this
world is concerned. The only mark on his
calm face, when his wife saw it, was that small
purple spot, where the wound had closed again.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have seen a snapshot taken of him as he
lay wrapped in his country’s flag. It is a noble,
chiselled countenance, looking younger than
the thirty-two years of his life, set in a great
serenity, with yet that stamp of austere renun<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>ciation,
of supreme sacrifice, measured and
accepted, which we sometimes behold in the
face of the dead.</p>

<p>The whole regiment congregated in the little
chapel the afternoon of the day which brought
the widow to her calvary. The building was
decorated with groups of flags, and about the
bier were heaped the wreaths of his brother
officers, dedicated nearly all in the same words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“To the comrade fallen on the field of honour,”</p>

<p>“To the comrade who has given his life for his country.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In the midst of a profound silence the Colonel
read <i>L’Ordre du Jour</i>, which, by King Albert’s
command, conferred upon the fallen <i>Guide</i> the
Order of Leopold&mdash;for valour&mdash;and the bereaved
wife was given the decoration to pin
over the cold heart that had been so warmly
hers. There was a muffled roll of drum, and
all present sang the “Brabançonne.” So much
for the comfort which the world could still give.</p>

<p>Next morning the funeral Mass was said at
the altar. The bier lay at the foot of the step,
so close that each time the priest turned round
to say <i>Dominus vobiscum</i>, his hands were uplifted
over the dead. And the widow and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
the officers of the regiment kneeling round
received Holy Communion for, and in memory
of, the slain.</p>

<p>It is not possible&mdash;although we know her
grief to be as ardent as was her attachment to
him&mdash;that this widow can mourn as those who
have no hope.</p>

<p>The chaplain of the regiment told her that
her husband had been to Confession and Holy
Communion the morning he had entered into
the trenches, three days before. “Have no
fear, my child,” said the priest, “he made his
Confession as he did everything, with all his
heart.”</p>

<p>Blessed religion, which across the deathbed
shows us the heavens opening for the departed
soul, and bids the holy angel guard even the
grave where rests the body, hallowed for the
resurrection!</p>

<p>She is the daughter of a Chinaman (an important
member of the household), and a neighbouring
lady. The Chinaman was, in fact, so
important that the usual matrimonial procedure
was reversed in his case; and the family of the
lady made unabashed and persevering advances
for his favour before he could be induced to
condescend to the alliance.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with Oriental calm will not
be surprised to learn that the potentate received
with imperturbability the announcement that
his lady wife was likely to present him with a
family. It was, however, perhaps pushing
Eastern reserve a little too far to walk away
from his infants with every appearance of disgust,
and to threaten to bite those officious
friends who sought to extract some show of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
parental feeling from him by turning him round
once more to confront the seething cradle-full.</p>

<p>The cradle was a flat basket, in which the
babies maintained a ceaseless movement, crawling
one over the other, with a total disregard
of such sensitive portions of the anatomy as
eyes and noses. They were extraordinarily
ill matched as to size&mdash;we do not know if this
is usual with triplets&mdash;looking more like a job
lot of Teddy-bears than anything else. There
was one as large as the other two put together;
there was a very lively medium one; and a
very small third, who lay and feebly squirmed
under the others vigorous toes. They all had
beautiful black noses and little cream-coloured
tails tightly curled over their backs. The
intelligent reader will by this time have perceived
that we are not referring to mere
humanity. The war-babies belong to the race
of Pekinese, being, in fact, the offspring of the
celebrated and priceless Loki, master of the
Villino of that name, who fame has already
spread far and wide.</p>

<p>His consort was Maud, a chestnut-haired
lady, who, we regret to say, had already contracted
a <i>mésalliance</i> with a highlander, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
despair of her family. We are convinced that
the union is regarded by Loki as a mere matter
of politics, but what Western would ever dare
to penetrate the barrier of relentless reserve
which the Manchu raises between his domestic
affairs and the foreign devil? We fear, by his
expression and the looks of reproach with
which he has since regarded us, that we have
already gravely infringed his ideas of decorum
by bringing his daughter to dwell in his house.</p>

<p>She is the only daughter of the trio, the two
extremes having run to the masculine gender.
We chose her on account of her perkiness and
her engaging manner of waving her paws in
supplication or allurement.</p>

<p>These little dogs have all of them more or
less the gift of gesticulation. It is not necessary
to teach them either to beg or pray. The
puppy&mdash;Plain Eliza&mdash;will dance half the length
of the room on her hind-legs, frantically imploring
with her front paws the while, with a
persistency and passion that would melt a
heart of stone.</p>

<p>The other day, when the butler walked on
the paw of Mimosa, the Peky nearest to her in
age, who rent the air with her yells, Plain Eliza<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>
instantly rose on her hind-legs and added her
lamentations. One can truly say that at the
same time she wrung her paws in distress over
her playmate’s suffering. She has a very
feeling heart.</p>

<p>These two adore each other, which is a very
good thing, because Mimosa is really a little
Tartar. She is the first fur-child to bring discord
into the happy family at Villino Loki, and
to break the Garden of Eden spell by which
cats and dogs of all sizes and tempers dwell
together in the most complete amity and sympathy.
A small, imperious person of a vivid
chestnut hue, with devouring dark eyes and
the most approved of snub noses, we flatter
ourselves that Mimosa will become a beauty
when she gets her full coat. But she will not
stand cats, still less a kitten, anywhere within
the kitchen premises, and Mrs. MacComfort,
the queen of those regions, has actually banished
the beloved Kitty and her offspring to the
greengrocer’s shop in order to pander to
Mimosa, who regarded them much as the
honest Briton the alien Hun&mdash;something darkly
suspicious, to be eliminated from the community
at all costs. Mimosa, indeed, has taken matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
into her own paws, as the man in the street
has done, and Mrs. MacComfort has acted like
the Government. Discovering the youngest
kitten completely flattened under Mimosa&mdash;the
latter, her mane bristling, endeavouring to
tear off all her victim’s fur&mdash;it was decided to
remove the alien element for its own benefit.</p>

<p>Harmony is now restored to kitchen dominions.
The other morning the young lady
of the Villino found the two little dogs solemnly
seated each side of the hearth, their eyes fixed
on an infinitesimal earthenware pan which was
simmering on a carefully prepared fire.</p>

<p>“They’re just watching me cooking their
breakfast, miss,” said Mrs. MacComfort in her
soft voice. “They’re very partial to chicken
liver.”</p>

<p>It was sizzling appetizingly in its lilliputian
dish.</p>

<p>From the moment of Plain Eliza’s entrance
upon the scene, squirming in a basket, Mimosa
showed a profound and affectionate interest in
her. We were, if truth be told, a little afraid
to trust these demonstrations, fearing they
might be of a crocodile nature, but never was
suspicion more unjust. The elder puppy has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
completely adopted the younger one, and is full
of anxiety and distress if she is not in her
company. She will come bustling into the
room, talking in her Peky way, saying as
plainly as ever a little dog did: “Has anyone
seen Baby? It’s really not safe to let the
child go about by herself like that.”</p>

<p>When she discovers her, the two small things
kiss and embrace; after which Mimosa abdicates
her grown-up airs, and romping becomes
the order of the day.</p>

<p>The name of Plain Eliza is the one which has
stuck most distinctively to the great Mo-Loki’s
daughter. It seemed appropriate to her, in the
opinion of the mistress of the Villino, and arose
out of a reminiscence of her Irish youth. There
happened to be in Dublin society in those far-back
days a young lady of guileless disposition,
not too brilliant intellect, and what Americans
would call “homely” appearance. Presenting
herself at a reception at a house which boasted
of a very pompous butler, and having announced
her name as Eliza Dunn, he forthwith
attempted to qualify her with a title.</p>

<p>“Lady Eliza Dunn?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” quoth she. “Plain Eliza.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Rumour would have it that he thereupon
announced in stentorian tones: “Plain Eliza.”</p>

<p>It is not so much the uncomeliness of the
Baby’s countenance as the guileless trustfulness
with which she turns it upon the world
which seems to make the name appropriate.
Anyhow, it has come to stay.</p>

<p>The little children that run about Villino
Loki these days&mdash;war-exiles, most of them&mdash;have
scarcely crossed the threshold before
their voices are uplifted, calling:</p>

<p>“Plain! Plain! Where is Plain Eliza?”
And when the favourite is found there is much
cooing and fond objurgations of: “Darling
Plain! My sweet little Plain! Dear, darling,
Plain Eliza!”</p>

<p>She is the only one of the Pekies that can
be allowed with perfect safety in the hands
of the children. Mimosa is uncertain, and may
turn at any moment with a face of fury, her
whole body bristling. She is secretly very
jealous of the children. And Loki is not uncertain
at all. He has never hidden his dislike
of them, and his lip begins to curl the instant a
small hand is outstretched towards him. But
Plain Eliza, if bored, remains patient and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
gentle; and however “homely” she may seem
to her attached family, she is all beauty and
charm in the eyes of their little visitors.</p>

<p>Recently a most attractive child was for ten
days, with her charming young mother and
baby brother, the guest of the Villino. To console
her on departure she was promised another
Plain Eliza, should such a one ever be
vouchsafed the world. Her mother writes:
“She prays and makes me pray for the
new Plain Eliza every day, and I think fully
expects to see her come shooting down from
Heaven.”</p>

<p>A very dear child this, with a heart and
mind almost too sensitive for her four years.
Many delicately pretty sayings are treasured
of her. She must have been about three when
her first religious instruction was given her.
It made a profound impression. For months
afterwards she would date her experiences
from the day of this enlightenment.</p>

<p>“You know, mammy, that was before Jesus
was born to me!”</p>

<p>Her father is at the front. He has not yet
seen his little son, the arrival of whom was
so much desired. This baby, an out-of-the-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>way
handsome, healthy child, is a prey to the
terrors which it will be yet mercifully many
years before he can understand. He cannot
bear to be left alone a moment, and wakes from
a profound sleep in spasms of unconscious
apprehension. Then nothing can soothe him
but being clasped very close, the mother’s hand
upon the little head, pressing it to her cheek.
“He is nothing,” said the doctor, “to some
of the babies I have seen this year.” It is not
astonishing; but how pathetic! These little
creatures, carried so long under an anguished
heart, come into the world bearing the print of
the universal mystery already stamped on their
infant souls.</p>

<p>When will the dawn arise over a world no
longer agonized and disrupted? When will
the wholesome joys and the natural sorrows
resume their preponderance in our existence?
Surely every man’s own span holds enough of
trouble to make him realize that here is not our
abiding-place, and long for the security of the
heavenly home. Perhaps it was not so. Perhaps
we had all fallen away too much from
faith and simplicity, and we needed this appalling
experience of what humanity can inflict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
upon humanity, when Christ and His cross are
left out of the reckoning.</p>

<p>“The world has become profoundly corrupt.
There will surely come some great scourge.
It will be necessary to have a generation
brought up by mourning mothers and in a
discipline of tears,” said a man of God in what
seemed words of unbearable severity, a year
before the war broke out.</p>

<p>So it may be that we are not only fighting
for our children, to deliver them from the
intolerable yoke of the Hun, but that we are
also suffering for our children, to deliver them
from the punishment of our own sins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We meant to call this chapter “War-babies,”
only for the newspaper discussion which has
made even innocence itself the subject of
passionate and unpleasant discussion.</p>

<p>There have been a good many war-babies in
the neighbourhood as well as Plain Eliza. The
Signorina of the Villino has already acted godmother
several times to infant exiles. These
little ones, we thank Heaven, have arrived
surprisingly jolly and unimpressed. Yet the
poor mothers had, most of them, fled from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
sound of the cannon and the menace of the
shells, happy if they saw nothing worse than
the flames which were consuming their homes
and all that those homes held and meant for
them. The Signorina is very particular that
the girls should be called Elizabeth and the
boys Albert, with due loyalty to a sovereignty
truly royal in misfortune.</p>

<p>“Mademoiselle,” writes one young woman,
“I have the happiness to announce to you that
I have the honour to have become the mother
of a beautiful little daughter.”</p>

<p>She meant what she said&mdash;marvellous as it
may seem not to regard the event in such
circumstances as an added anguish!</p>

<p>We have heard of the birth of a child to
a widow of eighteen&mdash;a peasant girl in Brussels&mdash;who
was forced by the invaders not only to
watch her father and husband and both brothers
struck down under her eyes, but to assist in
burying them while they were still breathing.</p>

<p>“It is a very ugly little baby,” writes the
kind lady who is its godmother, “and the poor
mother is very ill. When she gets better it
will be a comfort to her.”</p>

<p>In these days, when the lid of hell has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
taken off&mdash;as Mr. Elbert Hubbard, one of the
victims of the <i>Lusitania</i>, graphically declared&mdash;when
legions of devils have been let loose upon
an unsuspecting world, the case of the eighteen-year-old
peasant woman in the Brussels <i>asile</i> is
by no means the most to be pitied. Her child
will be a comfort to her. Not so will it be with
the many unfortunate Belgian village mothers&mdash;to
whom children are being, we hear, born
maimed in awful testimony of the mutilations
which the wives have been forced to witness
deliberately inflicted on their husbands. War-babies,
indeed! Stricken before birth, destined
to bear through a necessarily bitter existence
the terrible mark of the barbarian foe.</p>

<p>Let us get back to the fur children. It is
such a comfort to be able to turn one’s eyes
upon something that can never understand the
horror about one.</p>

<p>Plain Eliza’s only trick is to put her front
paws together, palm to palm, in an attitude of
prayer, and wave them. This is called in the
family “making pretty paws.” When the children
plunge for her and clasp her close, the
first cry is always: “Plain Eliza, make pretty
paws! Dear Plain Eliza, make pretty paws!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>She will not do it for them every day. Little
dogs know very well that human puppies have
no real authority over them. Perhaps it is
because of the rarity of her condescension in
this direction, or perhaps because of the
wonderful emphasis of her supplication when
she does so condescend, that the youngest of
the small exiles, three-year-old Viviane, regards
this accomplishment as the very acme of expression.
She is a pious babe, and is fond of
paying visits to the little Oratory in the Villino.
One day her governess observed her wringing
and waving her dimpled hands before the altar.
When she came out she confided in tones of
devout triumph: “I have been making pretty
paws to little Jesus.”</p>

<p>Viviane, the most satisfactory type of sturdy
childhood it is possible to imagine, combines
a great determination, an understanding as
solid as her own little person, with an extremely
tender heart. She quite realizes the
advantages of the good manners which her
English governess inculcates, and she can
be heard instructing herself in a deep <i>sotto
voce</i> when she sits at tea with grown-up entertainers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“Vivi not speak with her mouth full. Vivi
wait. Now Vivi can speak.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, my little girl,” said her mother
to her the other day, sending the child home in
advance to her early supper. “I hope you
will be good.”</p>

<p>“Vivi good,” was the prompt response, “good,
obedient, nice manners at table.”</p>

<p>She walked out of the room with her peculiarly
deliberate gait, murmuring the admonition
to herself.</p>

<p>During the terribly dry weather in the
beginning of May we had a great fire on our
moor; whether caused by incendiarism or not
remains a moot point. The first hill that rolls
up from our valley is now charred half-way.
Viviane was much concerned.</p>

<p>“Poor moor burnt! Poor moor burnt!” she
lamented. Then, with a delicious impulse
qualified by characteristic caution, “Vivi kiss
it where it is not black; kiss it and make it
well!”</p>

<p>When her cousin and playmate’s father was
tragically killed on the Yser, the little creature,
who is devoted to her own father, was deeply
concerned. The latter is heroically devoting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
himself to ambulance work at Calais. For
many nights after the news of the young
officer’s death was received, Viviane would
anxiously inform everyone who came into her
nursery that Papa was quite safe, pointing out
his photograph on the chimney-piece at the
same time.</p>

<p>“Vivi got her Papa quite safe,” in a confused
association of ideas.</p>

<p>Though she has only seen him once for a
very short time all these nine months, the
child’s affectionate memory of him remains as
distinct as ever, and returning the other day
from a morning walk with a scratched knee,
she declared pathetically she wished it had
been a wound, for then Vivi’s father would
have had to come and nurse her.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Belgian children is one of
the most remarkable things of the war. As
soon as they can understand anything at all
they seem to grasp the situation of present
valiant endurance and future glory. They
know what sacrifices have been demanded of
their parents. There is not a child that we
have seen but measures the cost and its honour.</p>

<p>Upon the arrival of the <i>Faire part</i> of that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
same young officer above mentioned, with its
immense black edge and unending list of
sorrowing relatives, Viviane’s eldest brother,
a boy of nine, asked to read it. When he came
to the words: <i>Mort pour la patrie</i>, he looked up,
his face illuminated.</p>

<p>“<i>Oh, Maman, comme c’est beau!</i>”</p>

<p>Not the least among the miscalculations of
the Germans in Belgium has been their insane
attempt to stifle the courage of the little country
by ferocity. But Germany has never counted
with souls, and it is by the power of the soul
that this huge monster of materialism, with its
gross brutality and gross reliance on masses
and mechanism, will be overthrown. There is
not a <i>gamin</i> of the Brussels streets that does
not mock the German soldiery, finely conscious
that, by the immortal defiance of the spirit,
Prussian brutality itself is already vanquished.
Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings!...</p>

<p>There was humour as well as heroism in the
heart of the oppressed Antwerp Belgian on
that afternoon of his King’s birthday, when he
sent the three little girls to walk side by side
through the streets dressed in black, orange,
and red. The Hun stood helpless before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
passage of the living flag, not daring to face
the ridicule which would fall upon him all the
world over were the babes arrested and taken
to the Commandatur. It was a superb defiance,
flung in the face of the despot, flung by the
little ones! The whole history of Belgium’s
glory and Germany’s shame is in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is just the feeling that they are blessedly
ignorant of the universal suffering that makes
the company of our pets so soothing to us
now.</p>

<p>“My dog is my one comfort,” cried a friend
to us, surveying her Peky as he sat, fat and
prosperous, his lip cocked with the familiar
Chinese smile, triumphant after the feat of
having silently bitten his mistress’s visitor.
“He is the only person that hasn’t changed!”</p>

<p>The bite of a Pekinese does not hurt, it may
be mentioned, and the visitor quite shared his
owner’s feelings.</p>

<p>It may be something of the same sensation
that makes the wounded soldiers in the hospital
near us long for the forbidden joy of something
alive for a mascot. They picked up a very
newly hatched pheasant in the grounds the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
other day, and carried it home to share their
bed and board. It was fed on extraordinary
concoctions, and after three days was discovered
to have passed away. There was a strong
suspicion of the matron, who had not approved
from the beginning. They consoled themselves
by a military funeral. A very handsome coffin
having been made by an expert, they went in
solemn procession to lay the infant pheasant
to rest. Now there is always a wreath on the
grave.</p>

<p>Invited to the Villino this week to see our
azaleas, they arrived, a batch of twenty, at the
odd hour of ten o’clock in the morning, to be
regaled with buns and lemonade, no tea-parties
being allowed. They enjoyed themselves very
much, but the feature of the entertainment was
Mimosa, the small ruby Pekinese. She passed
from embrace to embrace. She licked them so
much that they told the Sister they would not
need to have their faces washed any more.
This is the kind of joke that is really appreciated
in hospitals. When Mimi returned to
her devoted Mrs. MacComfort in the kitchen,
the latter remarked “she was so above herself
she couldn’t do anything with her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately all little dogs are not happy
and protected like ours. Belgian friends who
passed through villages and towns after the
first wave of the invader had spread over the
country tell us of a horrible and singular byway
of wanton atrocity. The soldiery slaughter
the dogs wholesale, some said to eat them, but
that seems hardly credible. Most probably it
was part of the scheme of general terrorism.
To burn the houses and slay the husbands and
fathers, to spear and mutilate and trample down
the children, to insult the women, it was all not
enough. The finishing touch must be given
by the murder of the humble companion, the
faithful watch-dog, the children’s pet. Piles
and piles of dogs’ heads were at the corners of
the streets, our friend told us.</p>

<p>We know they laid hold of the poor dogs to
experiment upon them with their diabolical
gas. But there was at least some reason in the
latter brutality.</p>

<p>One hears many stories about the dogs of
war.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the conflict the trained
ambulance dogs were reported to have done
splendid work in the French trenches. We do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
not know if we have any such, but we do know
that the men have pets among them out there,
whether mascots brought out from England or
strays picked up from the abandoned farms.
The deserted dogs! A French paper published
an article upon these dumb victims, not the
least pathetic of the many side tragedies of this
year of anguish. It was a poor shop-keeper
who described what he himself had seen in
passing through a devastated town within the
conquered territory.</p>

<p>“The dogs have remained in the town, from
whence the inhabitants have fled. The dogs
have remained where there is not left a stone
upon a stone. How they do not die of hunger
I cannot imagine. They must hunt for themselves
far out in the country-side, I suppose,
but they come back as quickly as they can and
congregate at the entrance of the suburb on
the highroad.</p>

<p>“There are two hundred, or three hundred
perhaps&mdash;spaniels, sheep-dogs, fox-terriers,
even small ridiculous lap-dogs&mdash;and they wait,
all of them, with their heads turned in the same
direction, with an air of intense melancholy
and passionate interest. What are they wait<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>ing
for? Oh, it is very easy to guess. Sometimes
one of the old inhabitants of the town
makes up his mind to come back from Holland.
The longing to see his home, to know what is
left of his house, to search the ruins, is stronger
than all else&mdash;stronger than hatred, stronger
than fear. And sometimes then one of the dogs
recognizes him. His dog! If you could see
it. If you could imagine it. All that troop of
dogs who prick their ears at the first sight of a
man coming along the road from Holland, a
man who has no helmet, a man not in uniform;
the instantaneous painful agitation of the
animals who gaze and gaze with all their might&mdash;dogs
have not very good eyes&mdash;and who sniff
and sniff from afar, because their scent is better
than their sight. And then the leap, the great
leap of one of these dogs who has recognized
his master, his wild race along the devastated
road, ploughed with the furrows by the passage
of cannons and heavy traction motors and dug
with trenches; his joyous barks, his wagging
tail, his flickering tongue! His whole body is
one quiver of happiness. The dog will not
leave that man any more, he is too much afraid
of losing him. He will follow close to his heels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
without stopping to eat; one day, two days if
needful; and in the end he goes away with him.</p>

<p>“But the others? They have remained on
the road. And when they see this dog depart,
having found at last what they all are seeking,
they lift up their muzzles despairingly and
howl, howl as if they would never stop, with
great cries that fill the air, and re-echo until
there is nothing more to be seen upon the road.
Then they are dumb, but they do not move.
They are there; they still hope.”</p>

OUR GARDEN IN JUNE</h2>

</div>
</div>

<p class="pfirst"><i><span class="smcap">June</span> 1.</i>&mdash;The garden in early June! Like a
great many other things the idea is very different
from the reality. The first of June in
the garden represents to the mind’s eye bowers
of roses, exuberance in the borders, a riot of
colour and fragrance. As a matter of fact, with
us, in our late-blooming, high-perched terraces,
it means a transition stage, and is annually
very exasperating and disappointing to the impatient
spirit of the Signora. It is the time
when the azaleas look dishevelled, with their
delicate blossom hanging depressingly from
the stamens. The forget-me-nots have all been
cleared away, and in those places where bulbs
are preserved against the future spring, masses
of yellowing tangled leaf-spikes are an eyesore.
The bedding-out plants still look tiny on the
raw borders. All our roses, except those
climbers against the house, are yet in the bud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
There are just the poppies that flaunt in the
borders; and even their colour becomes an
exasperation, because they would have done
so much better to wait and join in the grand
symphony, instead of blowing isolated trumpet
flourishes, prepared to relapse into sulky silence
when the delphiniums strike up their blue
music.</p>

<p>There is also another frightful drawback to
this first week of leafy June, and that is that it
would be easier to separate Pyramus from
Thisbe than the gardener from the vegetables.
A constant enervating struggle goes on between
us on the relative values of cabbages and roses,
beans and poppies. We want the roses sprayed,
we want the borders staked, we want sustenance
in the shape of liquid manure and Clay’s
fertilizer copiously administered to our darlings;
and he wants to put in “that there other
row of scarlet runners and set out them little
lettuces.” And when it comes to watering: he
doesn’t know, he’s sure, how he’s to get them
cabbages seen to as they ought to be seen to;
a deal of moisture <i>they</i> want, if they’re to do
him any justice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our terraces are panting. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
climbing roses up the house&mdash;and this year
they would have been glorious&mdash;are pale and
brittle in petal and foliage, as if they had been
actually blasted.</p>

<p>The master of the Villino, after due representations
from the Padrona, has seen the necessity
of sacrifice, and assiduously waters the garden
every evening&mdash;and himself! The hose is defective;
being war time we cannot afford a new
one. Two jets break out at the wrong angle
and take you in the eye and down the waistcoat
at the most unexpected moments; and
though amenable to persuasion, the Padrone’s
devotion has its limits, and he positively declines
the remanipulation of the tube which
will bring it&mdash;after having done service in the
Dutch garden&mdash;to the end of the Lily Walk.
So that, as it is two yards short, the deficiency
has to be made up by hand watering, and two
obsolete bath-cans are produced out of the
house, which seems, for some unexplained
reason, easier than using the proper garden
furniture. These cans are generally left, forgotten,
where they were last used, unless the
piercing eye of the mistress of the Villino
happens to dart in that direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Yesterday we had visitors&mdash;in eighteenth-century
parlance, a General and his Lady&mdash;and
of course the two cans stood in the middle
of the path, confidingly, nose to nose. Being
war time nobody minded. It is the blessing
and the danger of war time that nobody minds
anything. And the General’s Lady, being
tactful, kept her eye on the buddleia.</p>

<p>Death having come to the little garden and
taken Adam away; and greed of gain having
deprived us of Reginald Arthur in favour of
the post office; and patriotism having rendered
the local young man as precious as he is scarce,
we were five weeks&mdash;five invaluable, irreplaceable
weeks&mdash;gardenerless, odd-manless at the
Villino. Nothing this year will ever restore
the lost time. No amount of pulling and
straining will draw the gap together.</p>

<p>Japhet, Adam’s successor, is worn, as the
Americans say, very nearly “to a frazzle.”
He is a deeply conscientious man, and peas
and beans and cabbages are to him the very
principles upon which all garden morality is
built up. He was much grieved the other day
when someone “passed a remark” on the
subject of weeds in the back-garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span></p>

<p>Weeds! We should think there were! It
was so blatantly self-evident a fact that we
wondered that anyone should have thought it
worth while to pass a remark upon it. But
Japhet was hurt to his very soul: considering
his vocation, it would perhaps be more in keeping
to say&mdash;his marrow.</p>

<p>Professional pride is a very delicate and
easily bruised growth. When the Padrona was
in her teens the whole of her mother’s orderly
establishment was convulsed one June&mdash;a
hot June it was too&mdash;because the professional
pride of the family butler had been wounded
by the footman’s presuming to hand a dish
which it was not his business to touch. His
sense of dignity was doubtless sharpened to a
very fine edge by the fact that, the June weather
being so hot, an unusual amount of cooling beer
had been found necessary. This may seem a
curious mixture of metaphors, nevertheless the
facts are exact.</p>

<p>Reilly&mdash;that was his name&mdash;was very deeply
and, in the opinion of the rest of the household,
justifiably incensed when Edmund lifted the
entrée dish with the obvious intention of offering
it to his mistress; and though it was re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>garded
as an exaggeration of sensitiveness for
him to knock the footman down immediately
after lunch in the seclusion of the pantry, to
kneel upon his chest and endeavour to strangle
him with his white tie; and though the cook
deemed it incumbent upon her to draw the
attention of the authorities to the drama by
seizing a broom and brushing it backwards
and forwards across the row of bells; all the
sympathies of the establishment remained with
Reilly, and “the mistress” was regarded as
extremely hard-hearted for dismissing him
from her service. The footman was a shock-headed,
snub-nosed youth, and we will never
forget his appearance when, released from his
assailant, he burst into the dining-room, collarless,
his white tie protruding at an acute angle
behind his left ear, with a mixture of triumph,
importance, and suffering upon his scarlet
countenance.</p>

<p>So we were compassionate with Japhet
when he waxed plaintive over his underling’s
house duties, and even forbore having the
windows cleaned for several weeks, and
endured tortures at the sight of her spattered
panes, out of regard for his difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>The underling is aptly named Fox. He
has red hair and long moustaches and a furtive
eye and a general air of alertness and
slyness which show that if he had ever belonged
to the animal kingdom in a previous
state of existence, Vulpus he certainly was.
But we did not expect him to develop garden
susceptibilities too. This, however, it seems
he has done.</p>

<p>“I’ve very bad news for you,” said Japhet
sombrely to his master last week, when he
came into the long, book-lined room to receive
his Saturday pay. He has naturally a lugubrious
countenance.</p>

<p>His master’s thoughts flew to Zeppelins,
spotted fever, and other national dangers.</p>

<p>“Indeed, Japhet. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Fox, he says, he can’t put up with the
couch-grass and the docks in the lower garden.
They seem to have got on his mind, like. He
don’t see how he can go on dealing with them.
They <i>’ave</i> got a strong hold,” concluded Japhet
with a sigh, as if he too were overwhelmed by
the enemy.</p>

<p>Well, it was tragic enough, for the precious
Fox had been caught after long hunting, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
had made his own bargain&mdash;a foxy one&mdash;with
every eye to the main chance. We want to keep
him, but have a guilty sensation too, he being
young and strong, and obviously the right
stuff for enlisting; though, indeed, if docks
and couch-grass daunt him, how would he
stand shrapnel and gas?</p>

<p>The daughter of the house, who is extremely
tactful, and who is generally trusted with
delicate situations, interviewed him on the
spot. She found him in a condition only to
be described as one of nerve-shock. His long,
red moustaches quivered. All he could reply,
in a broken voice, was:</p>

<p>“It don’t do me no credit. It won’t never do
me no credit.”</p>

<p>Japhet, consulted, gave it as his opinion that
it was not a question of his subordinate’s
bettering himself; but said “Fox had always
been a sensitive worker.” Nevertheless, we
should not be surprised to hear that war prices
have something to do with it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is only now, after nearly five years, that
we are beginning to reap some benefit of our
constant planting. The Signora wonders if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
her irritable mind had allowed her to leave
undisturbed those divers perennials and bushes
which she had rooted up after a year’s trial
from beds and borders, how might she not now
be gathering the reward of longanimity.</p>

<p>The Léonie Lamesche roses, for instance.
She hunted them out of the middle of the
Dutch garden; out of the beds before the
entrance arches into the rose-garden; into that
corner of the kitchen-garden where the derelicts
gather. And just now the child of the house
has brought into her bunch after bunch of little
orange-crimson pompoms, delicious and quaint
to look at, and delicious and quaint to smell,
with their faint tartness, as of apples, mixed
with an aromatic herbiness as of myrtles.</p>

<p>“There’s quantities more,” says the Signorina.
Poor little things! they have been allowed to
settle and spread their roots, and one would
not know them for the nipped, disreputable,
guttersnipe objects that hitherto called down
the master of the Villino’s scorn.</p>

<p>We do not regret them in the Dutch garden
after all. It is too near the house not to have
its garland for every season; and the forget-me-nots,
hyacinths, and tulips are too precious and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
beautiful in the spring. But under the rose-arches
now there are gaps; and this year, between
the loss of our poor Adam and war
scruples, these gaps have not been filled.</p>

<p>If the Signora had left Léonie Lamesche
where she was, all those nice varnished green
leaves and all those darling rosettes of bloom
with their odd colour and fragrance would be
in their right place, instead of in the waste
ground from which Japhet, with the zeal of the
new broom, is already preparing to sweep them
next autumn&mdash;not, be it said, with any special
disapprobation for Léonie, but because he
declares he wants to get rid of all that there
stuff which hadn’t no right to be in a vegetable
garden at all.</p>

<p>The moral is&mdash;as has been said long ago in
the “Sentimental Garden”&mdash;that chief among
the many virtues a garden inculcates is patience.
If the Signora had had patience, she would not
have turned all the Standard Soleil d’Or and
Conrad Meyers out of the Lily Walk, because
the shadow of the buddleias interfered with
their bloom. For behold! this winter’s snow
has cast the great honey-trees sideways, and
the united efforts of Japhet and Fox, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
pulled and propped and strained in vain, have
left them sideways, and sideways, in the opinion
of these experts, they will for ever after remain.
And the Lily Walk is in full sunshine. Had
we but left the standards, who, of course, will
be sulky in their new positions for a couple of
years more!</p>

<p><i>June 15.</i>&mdash;The complaint begun in the first
week of our transitional garden has already
been reproved by the mid-month’s splendours.
In spite of the drought and the desiccating
south-east winds (which by some inscrutable
decree of Providence have been sent to us this
year when so much depends upon field, orchard,
and garden), the roses are magnificent and of
unusual promise.</p>

<p>Our peony beds&mdash;the mistress of the garden
did know that peonies are slow ladies and will
take their time&mdash;are beginning to reward her
forbearance. Such a basketful as came into
her bedroom to-day with the Polyantha roses!&mdash;those
large, pink, scented beauties which are
so satisfying to settle in big bowls. We have
put them in the chapel against boughs of the
service-tree. The effect is all one could wish.</p>

<p>The service-tree bloomed this year as never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
it bloomed before. It looked like the bridal
bouquet of a fairy giantess! We trust this
daring hyperbole will enable our readers to
represent to themselves something at once
immense and ethereal, misty grey, and delicate
silver-white. It is of huge size and
beautiful shape, and grows a little higher on
the slope than the greater of the two beech-trees.
For colour effect we know nothing more
soul-filling than the way it stands between the
ardent tawny glories of the Azalea Walk and
the young jewel green of its cousin&mdash;the beech
above mentioned. Put the shoulder of the
moor at the back in its May mantle of coppery
mauve heather not yet in bud&mdash;that is a
picture to gaze upon under a blue sky, thanking
God for the loveliness of the earth!</p>

<p>This last May, which will be ever memorable
as one of the most tragic months of the war,
hazard&mdash;or that <i>slithy tove</i>, the alien Hun&mdash;provided
us with a background approximately
<i>macabre</i> for the radiant youthful joy. Our
moor has been burnt&mdash;five fires started simultaneously
one day of high east wind, and the
first great swelling hill is covered with a garment
as of hell. The scattered fir-trees here<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
and there are of a livid, scorched brown. To
look out on the scene and see them stand in
the slaty black, casting mysterious shadows
under the dome of relentless brightness we
have had of late, is like looking upon a circle
of Dante’s Inferno, out of one of the cool,
bowery regions of his upper Purgatorio. Our
daughter finds a wilder beauty in our blossom
and verdure against the savage gloom beyond;
but not so the Padrona. She laments the
tapestry of her peaceful, rolling heights. Now,
past mid-June, bracken is creeping slowly
through the charred roots of the heather, and
she does not want a bracken hill. It is spreading
democracy, taking the place of some royal
line; the rule of the irresponsible, the coarse,
the mediocre; though she grants there will be
beauty in the autumn when it all turns golden.
And perhaps there’s a lesson to be drawn
somewhere, but she will have none of it, for
there is nothing so tiresome as the unpalatable
moral.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fox has condescended to remain another
week, so we need not feverishly search garden
chronicles for the quite impossible he, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
shall be strong, sturdy, ineligible for the army,
and willing to take a place as under-gardener
at something less than the honorarium of an
aniline dye expert! All those who want places
are head-gardeners, “under glass”; except
“a young Dutchman speaking languages perfectly”
who fills our souls with doubt. In every
district it is the same story; we wish we could
think it was all patriotic ardour, but we are
afraid that the high wages offered by camps
and greengrocers are responsible for a good
deal of the shortage of labour in our part of
the world.</p>

<p>One of the Villino quartette&mdash;we call ourselves
the lucky clover-leaf&mdash;writes from Dorset
that they have an aged man of past seventy-two
who comes in to help in the flowery, bowery
old garden of the manor-house where she is
staying. In justice to simple rural Dorset, it
may be mentioned parenthetically that there
the response to the country’s need has been
extraordinary in its unanimity. So the superannuated
labourers who have grown white and
wise over the soil, instead of sitting by the
chimney-corner and enjoying their old-age
pensions, come tottering forth to do their little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
bit, in the place of the young stalwartness that
has gone out to fight and struggle and perhaps
die for England.</p>

<p>Our Dorset clover petal writes: “Old Mason
is very sad at having to water the borders.
‘Ye mid water and water for days and days,’
he declares, ‘and it not have the value of a
single night’s rain. There, miss, as I did say
to my darter last night, my Father, I says, he
do water a deal better than I do.’”</p>

<p>Yesterday there came a box of white pinks
from that Dorset garden; these have been put
all together into an immense cut-glass bowl,
with an effect of innocent, white, overflowing
freshness that is perfect of its kind. And the
scent of them is admirably fitted to the sweet
clean wonder of their looks. It is a quintessence
of all simple fragrance, a sort of intensified new-mown
hay smell. That is another thing the
heavenly Father has done very well&mdash;the
delicate matching of attributes in His flower
children. A tea-rose looks her scent, just as
does her deep crimson sister.</p>

<p>“How it must have amused Almighty God,”
said our daughter one day last winter, lifting
the cineraria foliage to show the purple bloom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
of the lining which exactly matched the note
of the starry flower, “how it must have amused
Him to do this.”</p>

<p>And surely a violet bears in her little modest
face the promise of her insinuating and delicate
perfume.</p>

<p>And if the big pink peonies had had bright
green instead of shadowy grey foliage they
might have been vulgar.</p>

<p>And if you had put lily leaves to an iris
instead of their own romantic sword-blades,
how awkward and wrong it would have been;
whereas the lily-stalk, with its conventional
layers, is perfection in support of the queenly
head of the Madonna or the Auratum. It is
not association, but recognition of a Great
Artist, in all reverence be it said: “He hath
done all things well.”</p>

<p>To come back to the walled enclosure about
the old Dorset manor house. Here, looking
down our wind-swept terraces, we sometimes
hanker for the sunny seclusion of that walled
garden, though apparently all is not perfect
even there, for the last message from it
says:</p>

<p>“The strong sun takes all the strength out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
of the pinks after the first day or two. It has
been very hot in the early afternoon, and as the
garden faces west all the poor little things are
drawn in a long slant towards the setting sun.
Some of the long-stemmed ones have got positive
wriggles in their stalks from so much
exercise; it is really bad for their systems.”</p>

<p>In a previous letter she writes less pessimistically:</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you the loveliness of the garden.
It is like Venus rising from the sea&mdash;Venus
and her foam together&mdash;roses, pinks, sweet-williams,
everything leaping into bloom and
over the walls. I have given up trying to
harmonize colours. There is nothing so wilful
as an old garden. The plants simply walk
about, much as our ‘Pekies’ do. I planted
nigella last year, which didn’t do very well;
however it skipped across a path of its own
accord this year, and there is a patch of it in a
forbidden corner which shames the sky. One
looks on and laughs helplessly, as one does
with ‘Pekies.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Penzance briar hedge dividing the
new rosary from the reserve garden promises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
very well. It is already breaking into many
coloured stars, carmine, pink, amber, and the
fashionable khaki. Is this the musk-rose of
the “Midsummer Night’s Dream”?</p>

<p>To contradict our statement of a page or two
back, the Creator has made here one of the
exceptions to His rule of rich and delicate
balance, and it is the unsuspected fragrance of
the sweetbriar that adds so extraordinarily to
its attraction in a garden. No one would credit
it with the scent, its evanescent fragile bloom
gives no indication of it. And, like the perfectly
saintly, its fragrance has nothing to do
with youth or beauty. You pass an unimportant-looking
green bush, and all at once you
are assailed with the breath of Heaven. There
is a mystery, almost a mysticism, about the
perfection of this sweetness, this intangible,
invisible beauty. One is reminded of Wordsworth’s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“quiet as a nun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathless with adoration.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is the image of a pure soul exhaling itself
before God, in a rapture of ecstatic contemplation.</p>

<p>The June scents of the Villino garden are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
very wonderful, peculiarly so this year,
under the searching brilliancy of the unclouded
heavens. There is the sweetbriar, and there
are the pinks, and there is one long border all
of nepeta&mdash;against the Dorothy Perkins hedge
still only green&mdash;with its pungent, wholesome
savour. And there is the gum cistus, that
smells exactly as did the insides of the crimson
Venetian bottles which stood in the great
white and blue and gold drawing-room in the
Signora’s Irish home. It was an old custom to
put a drop of attar of roses at the bottom of
these favourite ornaments in those days when
the Signora was a little girl, and it was one of
her great joys to be allowed to lift the stopper
and sniff. The strange far-off Eastern incense
that hangs about the rather uncomely straggling
shrub&mdash;another instance of the Almighty’s exceptions&mdash;brings
the mistress of the Villino
back with a leap to her childhood; to the late
Georgian drawing-room, with its immense
plate-glass windows hung with curtains of
forget-me-not blue brocade which cost a hundred
pounds a pair&mdash;people spent solid money
then for solid worth; the white marble chimney-piece,
with its copy of a fraction of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span>
Parthenon frieze&mdash;Phaeton driving his wild,
tossing horses; the immense cut-glass chandelier
sparkling and quivering with a thousand
elfin rainbow lights; the white and gold panels,
the plastered frieze of curling acanthus leaves;
and the smiling face of the adored mother looking
down upon the little creature in the stiff
piqué frock, who was the future Padrona. No
child analyzes its mother’s countenance. It is
only in later years that the beauty of that smile
was recognized by her. It was a beauty that
endured to the very last of those eighty-five
years of a life that was so well filled. It was
a smile of extraordinary sweetness and, to
that end, full of youth. That’s what the gum
cistus brings back; a fragrance of memory,
poignant and beloved. Everyone knows that
through the sense of smell the seat of memory
is most potently reached. The merest whiff
of a long-forgotten odour will bring back so
vividly some scene of the past that it is almost
painful. It is to be wondered why ghosts do
not more often choose this form of return to
the world. The story told by Frederick Myers
in his “Human Personality” of the phantom
scent of thyme by which a poor girl haunted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
the field where she had been murdered is,
we believe, unique; but we know another
record. This was not the struggle of any
reproachful shade to bring itself back to human
recollection, but the ghost of a fragrance itself.
The late Bret Harte told the tale to a friend
of ours. On a visit to an old English castle he
was lodged in a tower room. Every afternoon
he used to withdraw for literary labours, and
at a certain hour the whole of the old chamber
would be filled with the penetrating vapour of
incense. He sought in vain for some explanation
of the mystery. There was nothing within
or without, beneath or above, which could produce
such a phenomenon. Then he bethought
himself of investigating the past, and found
that his room was exactly over what had once
been the chapel in the days of our ancient
Faith, and that it had been the custom to celebrate
Benediction at the hour when the incense&mdash;that
wraith of a bygone lovely worship&mdash;now
seemed to surround him.</p>

<p>A few steps beyond the gum cistus the
buddleia trees this June have their brief splendour
of bloom and their intoxication of perfume.
It is as if all the honey of clover and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
gorse, with something of a dash of clove spice,
was burning in a pyre of glory to the sunshine.
What wonder that the bees gather there and
chant the whole day long! Happy bees, drunk
with bliss in the midst of their labour!</p>

<p>It is all very well to speak of bees as a frugal,
hard-working community, to hold them up to
the perpetual emulation of the young. Few
people seem to remember how extremely
dissipated they become when they come across
a good tap of honey. Who has not seen them&mdash;so
charged with the luxuriance that they can
scarcely stagger out of the calyx&mdash;buzz away,
blundering, upon inebriated wing?</p>

<p>Greatly favoured by Nature, the bees combine
the extreme of laudable activity with the
extreme of self-indulgence. Anyone who wants
to hear their pæan of rapture at its height, let
him provide them with <i>Buddleia globosa</i>.</p>

<p>We have by no means exhausted the list of
scents in the June garden. There are the
irises! All Florence is in the sweetness that
flows from them: a sweetness, by the way, not
adapted to rooms, where, to be unpoetical, it
assumes something faintly catty. The way the
perfume of irises rolls over Florence in May is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
something not to be described to anyone who
has not breathed it. We were once the guests
of a kindly literary couple, who dwelt in one of
those charming, quaint, transmogrified farmhouses
outside the city that makes us&mdash;even
we who own the Villino Loki&mdash;hanker. It was
called Villa Benedetto. One drove out from
Florence along a road now only vaguely
remembered. It skirted the river, and there
were wild slopes on one side and poplar-trees;
then one darted aside into the Italian hills and
up a steep ascent&mdash;this vision is also vague;
but we remember the little garden-gate and
the narrow brick path and the irises! Irises
and China roses! It is a lovely mixture for
colour; and as for scent! anyone who knows
anything about scent (and we wonder why
there are not artists in it, as well as for music
and painting) anyone who knows anything
about scent, we repeat, is quite aware that
orris, the pounded iris root, is the only possible
fragrance to keep constantly about. It combines
the breath of the mignonette and the
subtle delight of the violet. It preserves, too,
its adorable freshness of impression. You
never sicken of it, you never tire of it. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
it has the fault of its delicacy, it is evanescent;
but, then, it is never stale. Any woman who
wishes an atmosphere of poetry should use
nothing but orris, the pure pounded root without
any addition, and that perpetually renewed.
Precious quality, it cannot be overdone.</p>

<p>The odour of the flower itself in the sunshine
is a different thing, far more piercing and far
more pronounced. It must be enjoyed in the
sunshine, or after a spring storm. Those other
incomparable banquets to the sense which a
bean-field or a clover-meadow will spread for
you cannot be captured and refined in the same
manner. More’s the pity!</p>

<p>Lafcadio Hearn declares that human beings
have lamentably failed to cultivate the rich
possibilities of the sense of smell. In this
respect, he says, dogs are infinitely superior.
Who can tell, he asks, what ecstasy of combination,
what chords, what symphonies of harmony
and contrast, might we not be able to serve
ourselves? But we do not think the idea will
bear development, and certainly many suffer
enough from an over-sensitiveness of nostril
already to prevent them from desiring any
further cultivation of its powers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>The Villino in June smells very good, however,
and that is gratifying. And to complete
the catalogue there are the new pine shoots
delicious and aromatic, stimulating and healthy;
a perfect aroma on a hot day.</p>

<p>“Tell me your friends and I will tell you
what you are,” says the sage; it sounds like a
dog, but the Padrona feels that with one sniff
she can sum up a character.</p>

<p>When Tréfle Incarnat, or its last variant,
takes you by the throat, you needn’t look to
see what kind of young woman is sitting beside
you at the theatre.</p>

<p>And when a portly friend, resplendent in
gorgeous sables, heralds her approach with a
powerful blast of Napthaline, you know the
kind of woman <i>she</i> is, and that the word
“friend,” just written, is misapplied; for you
never could make a friend of anyone so stuffily
and stupidly careful.</p>

<p>And when you go to tea with an acquaintance&mdash;probably
literary, living in Campden
Hill and fond of bead blinds&mdash;and the smell
of joss-stick floats upon the disgusted nostril
from the doorway, you know the kind of party
you are going to have. Your hostess will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
have surrounded herself with long-haired and
dank-handed young men, the Postlethwaites of
the period, and brilliant young females who
wear a mauvy powder over rather an unwashed
face, and curious garments cut square
at the neck, and turquoise matrix ear-rings,
very much veined with brown! Besides the
joss-sticks there is cigarette smoke, and the
atmosphere, morally as well as physically, is
fusty!</p>

<p>Then there is the female who produces a
bottle of Eau-de-Cologne on board ship. If
it isn’t a German governess, it is a heated
person with something purple about her and
kid gloves&mdash;why pursue the horrid theme!</p>

<p>Let us end this divagation by a little
anecdote as true as it is charming. It
happened to a member of our own family.
She was hurrying along one foggy November
morning to the Brompton Oratory rather
early; and the dreadful acrid vapour and
the uncertain struggle of a grimy dawn contended
against the glimmer of the gas-lamps.
As she approached the steps of the church
somebody crossed her, and instantly the whole
air was filled with an exquisite fragrance as of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
violets. Involuntarily she started to look round,
and her movement arrested, too, the passer-by.
For a second they stood quite close to each
other, and to our relative’s astonishment she
saw only a small, meek-faced old lady in an
Early Victorian bonnet wrapped in a very
dowdy dolman.</p>

<p>The old lady gave a little smile and went her
way. There was certainly no adornment of
real violets about her, and to look at her was
enough to be assured that artificial scents
could never approach her.</p>

<p>The incident seemed strange enough to be
worth making investigations, and the explanation
was simple. The little old lady
was very well known; mother of priests, a
ceaseless worker among the poor; nearly
eighty, and every day at seven o’clock Mass.
Many people had remarked the scent of violets
about her, and her friends thought, laughingly,
it was because she was something of a
saint.</p>

<p>This sweet-smelling saint died as she had
lived. She had received the Last Sacraments;
she knew her moments were numbered, but
she sat up, propped by pillows, and went on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
knitting for the poor till the needles fell from
her hands.</p>

<p>If the story of the violets had not happened
to a member of the family, the Signora would
be quite ready to believe it on hearsay, because
of the delicious simplicity and certain confidence
of that placid deathbed.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">We</span> asked them to tea; the Sister said that “the
Matron said they couldn’t do that”; but they
could come for morning lunch about half-past
ten o’clock, and have bread-and-butter and see
the garden. And they would like to come
very much indeed, preferably next day. The
Matron further opined about twelve would
feel well enough to avail themselves of our
hospitality.</p>

<p>It gave us very little time for preparation,
and the baker declined to provide us with buns
so early. But it was very hot, fortunately; so
Mrs. McComfort set to work at dawn to prepare
lemonade and fruit salad, and immense
slices of bread-and-jam. And we were very
glad she had been so lavish in her Irish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
generosity when we heard the sound of voices
and the tramping of feet in the courtyard: it
seemed as if there were a regiment of them! In
reality there were only twenty&mdash;twenty smiling,
stalwart “blue-coat boys.” Some with an arm
in a sling; two or three limping along with the
help of a stick; one with a bandaged head;
three, in spite of a brave front, with that look
of strain and tragedy in the eyes which stamps
even those who have been only slightly
“gassed.”</p>

<p>They are very much amused at the little
outing, as pleased and as easily diverted as
children, not anxious to talk about their experiences,
but answering with perfect ease and
simplicity any question that is made to them
on the subject. They are chiefly excited over
our little dogs. We wish that we had twenty
instead of only three; or that we had borrowed
from a neighbour’s household for the occasion.
Every man wants to nurse a dog, and those
who have secured the privilege are regarded
with considerable envy by the others.</p>

<p>The younger members of the <i>famiglia</i> are
in a desperate state of excitement, and there is
a great flutter of aprons, and cheeks flame<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
scarlet under caps pinned slightly crooked in
the agitation of the moment.</p>

<p>Miss Flynn the housemaid, Miss O’Toole
the parlourmaid, are stirred to rapture to discover
an Irish corporal, wounded at Ypres.
We think they talk more of Tipperary&mdash;it really
is Tipperary&mdash;than of Flanders. Miss Flynn,
a handsome, black-eyed, black-haired damsel,
with a colour that beats the damask roses on
the walls of the Villino, has been born and
bred in England. She is more forthcoming
than Miss O’Toole, who has the true Hibernian
reserve; who looks deprecatingly from under
her fair aureole of hair, and expects and gives
the utmost respectfulness in all her relations
with the opposite sex.</p>

<p>They say this lovely sensitive modesty of the
Irish girl is dying out. The penny novelette,
the spread of emancipation and education&mdash;save
the mark!&mdash;facilities of communication,
have done away with it. More’s the pity if
this be true, for it was a bloom on the womanhood
of Ireland no polish can replace; it added
something incommunicably lovable to the grace
of the girls, something holy, almost august, to
the tenderness of the mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>When the Signora was a child in Ireland the
peasant wife still spoke of her husband as
“the master”; and in the wilds of Galway,
quite recently, she has seen the women in the
roads pull their shawls over their faces at the
approach of a stranger. The humble matron
of the older type will still walk two paces
behind her husband. These are, of course, but
indications of the austere conception of life
which an unquestioning acceptance of her faith
kept alive in the breast of the Irishwoman.
When she promised to love and honour him,
the husband became <i>de facto</i> “the master.”
Yet the influence of the Irish wife and mother
in her own home in no way suffered from this
conception of her duty. She was as much
“<i>herself</i>” upon the lips of her lord as he
“<i>himself</i>” upon hers. It used to be a boast
that the purity of the Irish maiden and the
Irish mother was a thing apart, inassailable.
The Signora’s recollections of Ireland, of a
childhood passed in a country house that kept
itself very much in touch with its poor neighbours
and dependants, bring her back many
instances of drunkenness among the men, alas!
and the consequent fights and factions; of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
slovenliness among the women, and hopeless
want of thrift and energy; in one or two
instances, indeed, of flagrant dishonesty; but
she never remembers a single occasion marked
by the shocked whisper, the swift and huddled
dismissal, or any of the other tokens by which
a fall from feminine virtue is mysteriously
conveyed to the child mind.</p>

<p>Among all the poor cottage homes, the
various farms, great and small, prosperous
or neglected, each with their strapping brood
of splendid youth, never one can she recollect
about whose name there was a silence; never
a single one of these dewy-eyed, fresh-faced
girls that did not carry the innocence of their
baptism in the half-deprecating, half-confident
looks they cast upon “the quality.”</p>

<p>Naturally there must have been exceptions;
and naturally, too, this state of affairs could
not have applied to some of the more miserable
quarters of the towns. Nevertheless, the Ireland
of a quarter of a century ago had not forgotten
she had once been called the Island of Saints;
and her mothers and daughters kept very
preciously the vestal flame alive in their pure
breasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>Times have changed, and more’s the pity, as
we have said. But now and again a flower
blooms as if upon the old roots, and though
Mary O’Toole is transplanted to England, we
trust that she may keep her infantile innocence
and her exquisite&mdash;there is no English equivalent&mdash;<i>pudeur</i>.</p>

<p>It was a picture to see her in her cornflower-blue
cotton frock, with her irrepressible hair
tucked as tidily as nature would allow beneath
her white cap, staggering under the weight of
a tray charged with refreshments for the
wounded. She is about five-foot nothing, with
a throat the average male hand could encircle
with a finger and thumb, but among the twenty
soldiers, all of different ages, classes, and, of
course, dispositions, who visited us that day,
there was not one but regarded her with as
much respect as if she had been six foot high
and as ill-favoured as Sally Brass&mdash;we hope,
however, with considerably more pleasure.</p>

<p>When the blue-coat boys have been duly
refreshed, they wander out into the garden.
They remind one irresistibly of a school, and
there is something tenderly droll in their complete
submission to the little plump sister, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span>
orders them about with a soft voice and certain
authority.</p>

<p>“No. 20, come out of the sun. No. 15, I’d
rather you didn’t sit on the grass.”</p>

<p>Then she turns apologetically to us: “It
isn’t that I don’t know it’s quite dry.” (We
should think it was, on our sandy heights,
after five weeks’ drought!) “But I never know
quite where I am with the gassed cases. That’s
the worst of them. They’re perfectly well one
day, and we say, ‘Thank goodness, <i>that’s</i> all
over,’ and the next day its up in his eyes,
perhaps!”</p>

<p>“I’ll never be the same man again,” suddenly
exclaims a short, saturnine young Canadian,
who has not&mdash;a marked exception to the others&mdash;once
smiled since he came, and who keeps
a dark grudge in his eyes. He seems perfectly
well, except for that curious expression, to our
uninitiated gaze, but his voice is weak and
there is a languor about his movements extraordinarily
out of keeping with his build, which
is all for strength, like that of a young Hercules.</p>

<p>“I’ll never be the same man again; I feel
that. It’s shortened my life by a many years.
So it has with them over there.” He jerks his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
thumb towards his comrades in misfortune.
“They’ll none of them ever be the same men
again.”</p>

<p>The Signora tries feebly to protest, but the
nurse acquiesces placidly. It is the hospital
way, and not a bad way either; misfortunes
are not minimized, they are faced.</p>

<p>The Signora has an unconquerable timidity
where other people’s reticences are concerned,
and was far from emulating the amiable
audacity of a close relative&mdash;at present on a
visit to the Villino&mdash;whose voice she hears
raised in the distance with query after query:
“Where was it? In your leg? Does it hurt?
Do you mind? Do you want to go back again?”
But when she sees that the men indubitably
like this frank attack, and respond, smiling and
stimulated, the silence of her Canadian begins
to weigh upon her. She tries him with a
bashful question:</p>

<p>“Is your home in a town in Canada?”</p>

<p>“No, not in a town. Three hundred and
eighty miles away from the nearest of any
importance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Then it must take you a long
time to hear from your people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>The young harsh face darkens.</p>

<p>The post only comes to his home out yonder
once a week, anyhow, but he hasn’t heard but
once since he left. Not at all since he came to
England wounded.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” exclaimed the Signora again,
scenting a grievance. “But if it’s so far away,
you couldn’t have heard yet.”</p>

<p>The lowering copper-hued countenance&mdash;it is
curiously un-English, and reminds one vaguely
of those frowning black marble busts in the
Capitol: young Emperors already savagely
conscious of their own unlimited power&mdash;takes
a deeper gloom.</p>

<p>He could have heard. No. 9 had had a letter
that morning, and <i>his</i> home was forty miles
further north.</p>

<p>“Had No. 9 a letter?” asks the little Sister.</p>

<p>She sits plump and placid in her cloak, and
looks like a dove puffing out her feathers in
the sunshine. We have said she has a cooing
voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, he had,” says the Canadian, and digs a
vindictive finger into the dry grass.</p>

<p>The Signora, fearing the conversation is
going to lapse, plunges into the breach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“What was your work at home? Farming,
I suppose.”</p>

<p>This remark meets with an unexpected
success. The poor, fierce eyes&mdash;that seem
never to have ceased from contemplation of
unpardonable injury since that day at Ypres
when the fumes of hell belched up before
them&mdash;brighten.</p>

<p>“Wa-al! I do sometimes this and sometimes
that. I can do most things. It’s just what I
happen to want to put my hand to. I’m master
of half a dozen trades, I am. I’ve been on the
farm, and I’m a blacksmith, and an engineer
on the railway; and a barber, and a butcher.”</p>

<p>“Dear me!” says the little Sister.</p>

<p>Her gaze is serenely fixed on the smiling
green path. From the shadow in which we
sit, it leads to a slope out into the blaze of the
sunshine, where a cypress-tree rises like an
immense green flame, circled with a shimmer
of light. But perhaps her tone conveys rebuke,
for our Canadian suddenly relapses into silence,
from which we cannot again entice him.</p>

<p>A little further away a friend who is staying
with us, and the relative above mentioned, are
listening with intense interest to the talk of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
tall, black-moustached soldier. His face is
very pale under its bronze; he is the worst
of the three gas victims who have come to-day.
It is only what are called the very slight cases
that are treated in the hospital close by.</p>

<p>A much older man this, who has been many
years in the army and came over with the
Indian division. He has a gentle, thoughtful
face. There is no resentment in his eyes&mdash;only
the look of one who has seen death very
close and does not forget&mdash;and a great languor,
the mark of the gas. He is talking very dispassionately
of our reprisals.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we have used our gas, the freezing-gas!
But it don’t seem hardly worth while.
It draws their fire so.” Then, with an everyday
smile and no more emotion in his tone
than if he were descanting on a mousetrap, he
goes on to describe the incredibly sudden effect
of what he calls the freezing-gas, which we
suppose to be the French Turpinite. “It
freezes you up, so to speak, right off on the
spot. You see a fellow standing, turning his
head to talk to a fellow near him. He lifts
his hand, maybe, in his talk like; then comes
along the gas, and there he stands. You think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
he’s going on talking. He’s frozen dead, his
arm up, looking so natural-like, same as might
be me this minute. Oh, it’s quick! what you
call instantaneous. But it ain’t ’ardly worth
while. The Germans, you see, it draws their
fire so. Two or three times we got it in among
our own men&mdash;oh, by mistake, miss, of course!”
This in response to the horrified ejaculation of
his interlocutor. “And that didn’t seem ’ardly
worth while.”</p>

<p>Beyond this group, again, the daughter of the
house, seated on a croquet-box, is surrounded
by three sprawling blue soldiers. One of them
is talking earnestly to her. The others are
so much engaged in a game of “Beggar my
Neighbour” with three-year-old Vivi, the
Belgian baby, that they do not pay the
smallest attention to their companion, and yet
what he is saying is horrible enough, startling
enough, God knows! The speaker is a fair,
pleasant-looking boy with a cocked nose, tightly
curling auburn hair, and an air of vitality and
energy that makes it difficult to think of him
as in anything but the perfection of health.
He is a territorial, and evidently belongs to
that thinking, well-educated, working class<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>
that has made such a magnificent response to
the country’s call.</p>

<p>“No, miss, we are not taking many prisoners
now. No, we’re not likely to. Well, think of
our case. Just one little bit out of the whole
long line. They caught our sergeant&mdash;the
sergeant of my company. We were all very
fond of him. Well, miss, they put him up
where we could all see him&mdash;top of their trench&mdash;and
tortured him. Yes, miss, all day they
tortured him in sight of us, and all day we
were trying to get at them and we couldn’t.
And when in the evening we did get at them,
he was dead, miss. We were all very fond of
him. We weren’t likely to give much quarter
after that. And our officers”&mdash;here he smiles
suddenly&mdash;“well, miss, we’re Territorials, you
see. Our officers just let us loose. We’re
Territorials,” he repeated. “They can’t keep
us as they keep the regulars. Not in the same
military way. No, miss, we didn’t give much
quarter!”</p>

<p>Our daughter groans a little. She understands,
she sympathizes, yet she regrets. She
would like our men to be as absolutely without
reproach as they are without fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t bring yourself down to
the level of the Germans,” she says; “you
wouldn’t cease doing right because they do
wrong?”</p>

<p>He fixes her with bright blue eyes, and they
are hard as steel.</p>

<p>“Your British blood will boil,” he says
slowly.</p>

<p>It seems impossible to associate such a dark
and awful tragedy with this slim English boy
and his unconquerable air of joyous youth.
The Signorina remembers the repeated phrase,
“We were all very fond of him,” and she
sickens from the thought of that hellish picture
of cruelty and agony on one side, of the impotent
grief and rage on the other.</p>

<p>To change the subject, she says:</p>

<p>“How were you wounded?”</p>

<p>And then it transpired he had been carrying
in the British wounded at the end of that
day. He had been hit in the leg without
knowing it, and just as he was starting off to
help to carry in the German wounded, he
collapsed.</p>

<p><i>To help to carry in the German wounded!</i>
Those Germans who had tortured his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
comrade all day! Dear Tommy! Dear,
straight, noble, simple British soldier! How
could one ever have mistrusted your rough
justice or your Christian humanity?</p>

<p>Real boy that he is, he warms up to the glee
of narrating his audacities when out at night
with a party on listening-post duty.</p>

<p>“Rare fun it was,” he declares.</p>

<p>He used to creep up to the enemy’s trench
and bayonet what came handy.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t fire, you see, miss, nor do anything
likely to make a noise, so it had to be
done on the quiet. But I got a good many
that way.”</p>

<p>Baby Vivi is tired of her game of cards. For
a while past she has been amusing herself by
boxing the two sitting soldiers. Very well-delivered
vigorous thumps she applies on their
chests with her little fists, and they obligingly
go over backwards on the grass. She now
comes to exercise her powers on the Territorial.
He catches her in his arms.</p>

<p>The men all look at the little girl with strange,
troubled, tender eyes. One knows what is at
the back of their thought. One of them expresses
it presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>“To think that anyone could ever hurt a
little creature like that!”</p>

<p>Vivi’s young mother sits with her small
group further away. She has told them how
she has fled out of her castle in the Ardennes
at dawn, without having had time even to pack
her children’s clothes. They had thought
themselves safe with the pathetic hopefulness
that filled poor Belgium from the moment
when the French troops and the English appeared
in strength upon the soil. “Now all is
well,” they said; “now we are safe.”</p>

<p>A French General and his staff lodged in the
château, and the men camped in the park. On
the vigil of the day fixed for their intended
advance, the General took her on one side. An
old man, he had been through the whole of the
war of ’70. He solemnly warned her of the
folly of remaining in her home, as she intended.</p>

<p>“Madame, I know the Germans. I know of
what they are capable. I have seen them at
work; I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p>Should the invader reach a certain point
within ten miles of the district she must fly.</p>

<p>All that night the aviators kept coming
with messages, and in the early dawn they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
started. She was up and saw the cavalcade
winding away through the park. She stood in
the porch to wish them God-speed. The young
men were full of ardour. They were going
forth to meet the enemy. The General was
grave. When he had reached the public road,
he sent one of his aide-de-camps riding back at
a gallop. Was it a premonition of disaster, or
had secret news reached him by some emissary
from the field of conflict? The message to her
was, that she was to be gone at once with her
family. At once!</p>

<p>The young husband had already departed at
break of day in their automobile. He and his
machine had been offered to the service of the
country and accepted. The mother, with her
four little children&mdash;among them the sturdy,
two-year-old Viviane&mdash;had to walk to the
station, with what luggage could be got together
and trundled down in a wheelbarrow. Luckily
it was not far&mdash;their own station just outside
the park-gates. They got the last train that
ran from that doomed spot. The German guns
were within earshot as they steamed away.</p>

<p>In their hurry they had forgotten to bring
any milk or water for the baby girl. The heat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
was suffocating. The only thing that could be
laid hold of was a bottle of white wine which
someone had thrust into a bag. Vivi clamoured,
and they gave her half a glassful in the end.
She enjoyed it very much, and it did not disagree
with her at all.</p>

<p>The men in their blue garb listen to some of
this story with profound attention. They have
a very touching, respectful, earnest way of
talking to the Belgian lady, and are very
anxious to impress upon her that soon they
will have her country cleared of the enemy.</p>

<p>“You tell her that, miss. She do believe it,
don’t she? We’re going to sweep them out in
no time. Tell her that, miss. That’s what
we’re over there for. She’ll soon be able to
get back there&mdash;back in her own home.”</p>

<p>One of them gazes at her for a while in a
kind of brooding silence, and then says huskily:</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a mercy you got away, ma’am&mdash;you
and your little children!”</p>

<p>He knows. He has seen.</p>

<p>Then Viviane is called upon to sing
“Tipperary.”</p>

<p>Though only just three, this child, as has
been said before, she looks a sturdy four. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>
most jovial solid, red-cheeked, blue-eyed,
smiling, curly-haired little girl that it is
possible to imagine. Her mother says that
she never lost her balance and tumbled down
even when she first began to toddle; and one
can well believe it. There is a mixture of
strength and deliberation in everything she
does that makes one regret she is not a boy.
But she has pretty, coaxing, coquettish ways
that are quite feminine.</p>

<p>She now puts her head on one side, and
ogles with her blue eyes first one soldier and
another, and smiles angelically as she pipes
“Tipperary.”</p>

<p>This is a favourite song among the infant
population these days. The child of a friend
of ours calls it her hymn, and sings it in
church.</p>

<p>There is something really engaging in Viviane’s
roll of the “r’s.” Her Tipperary is very
guttural and conscientious, and her “Good-bye,
Piccadeely” always provokes the laughter of
admiration.</p>

<p>Encouraged by applause, she bursts into,
“We don’t want to lose you, but we think
you ought to go.” And is quite aware, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
little rogue, of the effect she will presently
produce when, upon an incredibly high note,
she announces, “We will <i>keess</i> you.”</p>

<p>After this, she breaks into piety with, “Paradise,
oh! Paradise.”</p>

<p>The little plump nurse gets up and shakes
out her cloak. It is getting quite late, and they
must go back to the hospital. She marshals
her charges up on the terrace. They obey her
just as if they were very good little boys in
charge of their schoolmistress.</p>

<p>“Now say good-bye, and thank you. I’m
sure you’ve all enjoyed yourselves. No. 20,
where’s your hat? Go down and get your
hat, No. 20. No; his poor leg’s tired. You
go down and get it, No. 13.”</p>

<p>“I seen it a while ago,” No. 13 announces
obligingly.</p>

<p>They say “good-bye” and “thank you” with
the conscientiousness of their simple hearts.
We shake, one after the other, those outstretched
hands that grip back so cordially.</p>

<p>A guest of the Villino&mdash;an honoured guest,
who is not only one of the most distinguished
women artists of the day, but has lived all her
married life within sound of the drum; who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
has been always inspired by the sights and
scenes, the high glories and noble disasters of
warfare&mdash;expresses the feeling struggling in
our hearts as she retains the hand of the last
of the file of blue-coats in hers: “What an
honour to shake the hand of a British soldier!”</p>

<p>We hear them troop away through the little
courtyard, laughing and talking. We think, as
the small nurse said, that they have had a
pleasant time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the small side amusements in life is
to hear other people’s reflections upon experiences
that one has lived through together,
and to measure the distance that lies between
different points of view. It makes one realize
how extraordinarily difficult it must be to
obtain reliable evidence.</p>

<p>A neighbour has obligingly come in to help
us with the entertainment. She is the pleasant,
middle-aged Irish widow of an Irish doctor,
and her good-humour is as pronounced as her
brogue. Finding herself alone on the terrace
with the Signorina after the departure of the
convalescents, she mystified her with the
following remark:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>“How frightened the poor old lady was!”</p>

<p>The poor old lady? The Signorina was all
at sea. There was no one answering to such a
description among us to-day.</p>

<p>“The poor old lady,” repeated the other
firmly. “Yes, Lady &mdash;&mdash;. I was talking to
her, and oh! anybody could see how terrified
she was. Nervous, you know; trembling at
the mention of the war, upset, shrinking away.
And no wonder, I’m sure,” she concluded
genially. “Hasn’t she got a son out there?”</p>

<p>She betook herself down the steps towards
her cottage. Our daughter watched the purple-spotted
blouse meandering downwards from
terrace to terrace till it disappeared. She was
too astounded even to be able to remonstrate.</p>

<p>And, indeed, of what use would it have been?
That Lady &mdash;&mdash;, distinguished, humorous, with
her figure erect and slender as a girl’s, and her
refined, delightful face stamped with genius on
the brow, and with the most delicate humour
about the mouth; that this incomparable
woman, actually in the zenith of her power,
personal as well as artistic, a being whom it
seems that age can never touch, to whom the

all kinds of excellence, should have appeared
to anyone as the <i>poor old lady</i>! And that she
should be further classed among the frightened!
She who more than any fighter of them all
sees the romance of war, the high lesson of
war; who only the day before, speaking of a
discontented soldier friend, had said to us in
tones of wonder:</p>

<p>“He’s not enjoying war! It seems so strange.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to laugh. But
what an insight into the manner in which
“other people see us.”</p>

<p>In the Signora’s early teens her family indulged
in a Dublin season, during which a
very worthy prelate, the Cardinal Archbishop
of her Church, died. He was full of years and
good works, but at no moment of his existence
remarkable for good looks.</p>

<p>A sprightly housemaid of the establishment
demanded permission to go and visit the church
where he was laid out in state. On her return
the Padrona’s mother inquired how the sight
had impressed her, expecting a duly pious
response.</p>

<p>Quoth the damsel, with her brisk Dublin
accent:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>“Well, really, ’m, I thought the Cawdinal
looked remawkably well!”</p>

<p>As a rule, however, the Irish lower classes
are more quick to seize shades of feeling, refinements
of emotion, than the poor of other
races; especially&mdash;to hark back to a former
page&mdash;that peasantry of the older type in which
a vivid spirituality was kept alive by their
faith. A chaplain has written to us from the
Isle of Wight speaking of the immense consolation
he had had in the presence of some Irish
soldiers among the troops stationed there.
“Their faith made me ashamed.”</p>

<p>But indeed the feeling of religion among all
our men, of whatever creed, and from whatever
part of the British Isles they have come, is not
one of the least remarkable manifestations of
the war.</p>

<p>“I knew I would not be killed,” said a
wounded soldier beside whose bed we sat the
other day. “But I knew I’d come back a better
man, and I think I have.”</p>

<p>Then he added that the only thing that
troubled them, lying in hospital, was the
thought of the comrades in the thick of it, and
not being able to help them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” he went on thoughtfully, “we
can pray. We all do that, of course; we do
pray, and we know that helps.”</p>

<p>This man was neither Irish nor Catholic.</p>

<p>Infinitely touching are the remarks they
make, these dear fellows; beautiful sometimes
in their unconscious heroism.</p>

<p>“Well, at least,” said the Signorina to a man
permanently crippled by shrapnel, saddened
by the decision that he could never go back to
the front. “At least you know you’ve done
your little bit.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you see, miss,” he answered in all
simplicity, “among us the saying goes, no one
has really done his little bit till he’s underground.”</p>

<p>“Will you mind going back?” said a rather
foolish friend of ours to an exhausted, badly
wounded sufferer in a Dublin hospital. He
had seen Mons and its horrors, all the brutality
of war with little of its concomitant glory.
The eyes in his drawn face looked up at her
steadily.</p>

<p>“If it’s my dooty, lady, I’m ready to go.”</p>

<p>“I’d give my other leg to go back,” said a
maimed lad to Lady &mdash;&mdash;. He was in a hospital<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
at Lyndhurst, a fair, splendid boy, not yet
eighteen.</p>

<p>“Don’t make me too soft, Sister,” pleaded
an Irish Fusilier with five bullet wounds in his
back, to his kindly nurse in the little convent
hospital near here. “I’ve got to finish my job
out there.”</p>

<p>At a recent lecture delivered on “Five Months
with the British Expeditionary Force”&mdash;his
own experience&mdash;Professor Morgan made use
of these remarkable words: “Our men count
no cost too high in the service of the nation.
They greet death like a friend, and go into
battle as to a festival.”</p>

<p>What wonder, then, that there should be
such an unshakable spirit of confidence
throughout the whole of our army, for with
conscience at peace, and eyes fixed on their
high ideal, they go forth to fight, knowing that,
as a great preacher has said, those who do
battle in a just cause already carry the flame of
victory on their foreheads.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">The</span> master of the Villino got the telegram
when he was shaving, that morning of October
26.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Slightly wounded. Going London.&mdash;H.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He came straight in to the Signora, who
instantly read all kinds of sinister meanings
into the reticent lines.</p>

<p>Slightly wounded! H. would be sure to say
that whatever had happened. Even if he had
lost an arm or a leg he might very well try
and break it to us in some such phrase. There
were certainly grounds for consolation in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>
fact that he should be “going London,” but
were not the papers full of accounts of the
felicitous manner in which the transport of
very serious cases was being daily accomplished?</p>

<p>The only brother and very precious! Always
in the Signora’s mind&mdash;stalwart, middle-aged
man as he is&mdash;doubled by and impossible to
dissociate from a little fair-haired boy, the
youngest of the family, endeared by a thousand
quaint, childish ways. That he should be
wounded, suffering Heaven knew what unknown
horror of discomfort and pain, was
absurdly, but unconquerably to her heart, the
hurting of the child. Alas! if an elder sister
feels this, what must the agony of the mothers
be all through the world to-day!</p>

<p>We telephoned to the clearing station at
Southampton, and found that the ambulance
train had already started. Then the master of
the Villino, and the sister whose home is with
us, determined to leave for London themselves
and endeavour to trace our soldier.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when a comforting
telegram came through to those left behind; it
told us that H. had been run to earth; that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
wound was indeed favourable; that he was well
in health, and that we might expect him here
to be nursed in a couple of days.</p>

<p>Very glad the Villino was to have him, very
proud of its own soldier, deeply thankful to be
granted the care of him!</p>

<p>The Signorina immediately instituted herself
Red Cross nurse, the local lectures having
borne fruit after all. The wound was for us
and for him a very lucky one, but the doctor
called it dreadful, and, indeed, one could have
put one’s hand into it; and Juvenal, summoned
to assist at the first dressing, fainted at the
sight. But it had not touched any vital point,
and though the muscle under the shoulder-blade
was torn in two, it has left no weakness
in the arm.</p>

<p>Like all soldiers we have met, he will not
hear of the suggestion that it was inflicted by
a dum-dum bullet. Nevertheless, it is a singular
fact that where the bullet went in the
hole is the ordinary size of the missile, and
where it came out it is the size of a man’s fist.
Something abnormal about that German projectile
there must have been. But we were
ready to go down on our knees and thank God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
fasting for a good man’s life; and it was clear
that it would take a long time to heal!</p>

<p>Anyone who knows our soldiers knows the
perfectly simple attitude of their minds as far
as their own share in the great struggle is concerned.
Further, they have an everyday,
common-sense, unexaggerated manner of speaking
of their terrible experiences which helps us
stay-at-homes very much&mdash;we who are apt to
regard the front as a nightmare, hell and
shambles mixed.</p>

<p>“We were a bit cut up that day, but we got
our own back with the bayonet.”</p>

<p>“Well, they took our range rather too neatly,
but man for man Tommy’s a match for the Hun
any day, even if we were short of shells.”</p>

<p>“Poor lads! they had to trot off before they’d
had their breakfast&mdash;a six-mile walk and stiff
work to follow&mdash;after three days and three
nights of it below Hollebeke. We’d been sent
back for a rest when the message came; but
the men didn’t mind anything, only the loss of
the breakfast. ‘Such a good breakfast as it
was, sir,’ as one of them said to me. Six o’clock
in the morning and a six-mile march! A few
of the fellows clapped their bacon into their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
pockets. The line was broken and the Germans
coming in. Someone had to drive them out,
and the Worcesters came handy.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, we did it all right; running like
smoke they were, squealing&mdash;they can’t stand
the bayonet!”</p>

<p>That was the “little bit” where our soldier
got his wound.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing at all, me child.”</p>

<p>His sergeant dressed it first at the back of
the firing-line, then he walked into Ypres. He
went to the hospital, found it crowded&mdash;‘Lots
of fellows worse than I was’&mdash;so he strolled
away and had his hair cut!&mdash;“A real good
shampoo and a shave, and a bath, and then a
jolly good dinner!” And then he proceeded to
look up some nice fellows of the Irish Horse.
And in the end he went back to the hospital,
and they “did him up!”</p>

<p>When one thinks that in peace time, if anyone
had accidentally received such a wound, what
a fuss there would have been! What a sending
for doctors and nurses! what long faces! what
lamentations, precautions, and misgivings! It
makes one understand better the state of things
over there. How splendidly indifferent our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
manhood has become to suffering! How
gloriously cheap it holds life itself!</p>

<p>H. is happily not among those unfortunate
brave men who suffer nervous distress from
the sights, the scenes, and the strain of warfare,
but he has a keen, almost a poetic, sensibility
to the romance and tragedy of his
experiences.</p>

<p>As he sat, those November days, in one of
the deep arm-chairs before the great bricked
hearth in the Villino library, a short phrase
here and there would give us a picture of some
episode which stamped itself upon the memory
of the listener.</p>

<p>“Lord, it was jolty, driving along in the ambulance
to the station! The poor boy next to
me&mdash;badly wounded, poor chap! lost a lot of
blood&mdash;he got faint and lay across my breast;
went to sleep there in the end.”</p>

<p>“Shells? ’Pon me word, it was beautiful
to see them at night! Oh, one’s all right, you
know, if one keeps in one’s trenches. One of
my subalterns&mdash;ah, poor lad! I don’t know what
took him&mdash;he got right out of the trench and
stood on the edge, stretching himself. A shell
came along and bowled him over. We dug<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
him out. He was an awfully good-looking
boy. There wasn’t a scratch on him, but he
was stone dead; his back broken. And there
he lay as beautiful as an angel. The Colonel
and I, we buried him. He was twenty-three;
just married. The Colonel and I used to bury
our men at night.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the speaker’s shoulders shook with
laughter.</p>

<p>“Those shells! One of my fellows had one
burst within a yard of him. Lord, I thought
he was in pieces! He was covered in earth
and rubbish! ‘Has that done for you?’ I
called out to him. ‘I think it has, sir,’ he said,
and you should have seen him clutching himself
all over! And then there was a grin. ‘No,
sir, it’s only a bruise!’ Oh, you get not to
mind them, except one kind; that does make
a nasty noise&mdash;a real nasty noise; it was just
that noise one minded. Ugh, when you heard
it coming along! Spiteful, it was!”</p>

<p>In the private London hospital where he
spent three days the bed next to him was
occupied by a Major of Artillery, wounded in
the head.</p>

<p>“There was not much wrong with him, poor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
old chap! but he had got a bit of nerve-strain.
Lord, he never let me get a wink, calling out
all night in his sleep: ‘D&mdash;&mdash; that mist! I can’t
see the swine. A bit more to the left. Now,
now, boys, now we’ve got them! Oh, damn
that mist! Ha! we got them that time&mdash;got
the swine!’”</p>

<p>The doctors who saw our soldier were rather
surprised to find him so calm in his mind.
They could scarcely believe he should sleep
so sound at nights&mdash;that the human machine
should be so little out of gear. Yet there were
days when he called himself “slack,” looked ill
enough, and one could see that even a short
walk was a severe trial of strength.</p>

<p>We shall not lightly forget a funny little
incident which happened upon an afternoon
when he seemed peculiarly exhausted. He
was sitting in his arm-chair close to the fire,
looking grey and drawn, declaring that the
north-east wind never agreed with him. A
kindly clerical neighbour rushed in upon us.
He had just heard that fifty thousand Germans
had landed at Sheringham. All the troops
were under orders. Despatch riders had
galloped from Aldershot to stop the billeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
of a regiment just arrived here. The men had
started up in the middle of their dinners and
begun to pack again. They were to go back
to Aldershot and concentrate for the great
move. Further&mdash;indisputable authority!&mdash;the
Chief Constable of the county had private information
of the invasion.</p>

<p>You should have seen our soldier! He was
up out of his chair with a spring, his blue eyes
blazing. All the languor, the unacknowledged
stiffness and ache of his wound, were gone.
If ever there was a creature possessed with the
pure joy of battle it was he. How much the
womenkind miss who have never seen their
men leading a charge! What a vital part of a
man’s character lies dormant in times of peace!</p>

<p>There is, we believe, a large number of
people who regard this fighting spirit as a
purely animal quality; recently, indeed, a
certain professor delivered a lecture on the
subject of wild dogs and wolves who fight in
packs, with special reference to the present
state of humanity. These thinkers, sitting at
ease in their armchairs, placid materialists, who
have never known their own souls, much less
do they know those of their countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
What we saw in our soldier’s eyes was, we
swear, the leap of the spirit&mdash;the fine steel of
the soul springing out of the scabbard of the
body, the fire from the clay. Carlyle has somewhere
a lovely phrase anent that spark of
heroism that will burn in the heart of the lowest
British soldier, the poorest, dullest peasant
lad, and make of him hero and martyr, enable
him to face long agony and death, endure as
well as charge.</p>

<p>So H. flung off his languor and dashed out
of his armchair and sprang to the telephone to
order himself a car, and presently departed,
already invisibly armed, in search of&mdash;this time&mdash;an
invisible foe. For the foe was invisible!</p>

<p>No one knew whence the scare had come;
whether there were any real justification for
the preparations which were certainly ordered.
The regiment which had had to pack up again
just as it had got into its billets, and go back
to Aldershot in the very middle of its dinner,
was kept under arms all night; but there was
never the point of a single <i>Pickelhaube</i> visible on
the horizon at Sheringham or elsewhere. And
on examination it turned out that the “Chief
Constable” of the county, that unimpeachable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
and alarming authority, had been none other
than the local policeman, which was a comedown
indeed! But the thrill was not altogether
unpleasant, and we like to remember the sick
soldier springing up, that St. Michael fire in
his blue eyes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a short account written for his school
magazine, H. summarizes the experiences of
his own regiment at Ypres thus:</p>

<p>“All the officers in my company are wounded
or invalided. The men are very cheerful under
all the hardships and losses, and their behaviour
under fire is splendid. The Brigade (5th) has
been taken three times at least to ‘mend the
line’ where the Germans had broken through.
From October 24 to November 5 my regiment
lost about 450 officers and men&mdash;mostly, thank
God, wounded. The Germans can’t shoot for
nuts, but their artillery fire is accurate and
<i>incessant</i>, and the machine-guns very deadly.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is nothing more touching than the
devotion of the officers to their men. They
feel towards them truly as if they were their
children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“No officer,” said the widow of a great
general to us the other day, “ever thinks of
himself in action, ever casts a thought to the
bullets flying about him. Indeed, the officers
don’t seem to believe they can get hit; they’re
so occupied in looking after their men. All the
time they’re looking at their men.”</p>

<p>Even as we write these lines we see the
death, in the Dardanelles, of a young officer
who had been under H. when he was training
reserves during his recent period of convalescent
home service. This youth was, in our
brother’s eyes, the perfection of young manhood.
He prophesied for him great things.
He told us many stories of his quaint humour
and incisive wit. One anecdote remains.
Among their recruits were between twenty
and thirty extremely bad characters&mdash;slack,
undisciplined fellows, worthless material belonging
almost to the criminal classes. After
working in vain with all his energy to endeavour
to put some kind of soldierly discipline
into them, young W. paraded them in the barrack
yard, and addressed them in the following
language:</p>

<p>“His Majesty’s Government cannot afford<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
nowadays to spend money uselessly. You
are a dead waste to the nation. You are not
worth the food you get nor the clothes you
wear. It has been decided, therefore, to send
you to the front; and, as every man is bound to
do his utmost to help his country in the present
crisis, it is earnestly to be hoped that you will,
each one of you, endeavour to get himself shot
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>We understand that the result of this stringent
discourse on that “bad hat” squad was
miraculous, although the sergeant-major was
so overcome with mirth that he had to retire to
give vent to it.</p>

<p>This boy had been serving in the East in a
wild and difficult district, and had distinguished
himself so remarkably that he was summoned
to the Foreign Office to advise upon an expedition
which it was proposed to send to
those regions. Never was there any life so
full of promise. Gay and gallant youth, it
seems a cruel decree that the bullet of some
vile Turk should have had the power to rob
England of a son so likely to do her signal
honour and service in the future. “It is the
best that are taken”&mdash;a phrase sadly familiar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
just now that finds only too true an echo in
everyone’s experience.</p>

<p>There was another, whom we had known
from the time when he was an apple-cheeked
little boy in petticoats&mdash;a sunny, level-headed
child, who gave the minimum of trouble and
the maximum of satisfaction to his parents from
the moment of his appearance on this earth.
All his short life always busy, always happy.
His mother said that she had never seen a
frown of discontent on his face. Head boy at
Harrow, where the authorities begged to be
allowed to keep him on another year for the
sake of the good example he gave; writer of
the prize essay three years running; winner
of all the cups for athletics; champion boxer
and fencer&mdash;with these brilliant qualities he
had&mdash;rare combination indeed!&mdash;a steady, well-balanced
mind. With high ideals he had a
sober judgment. He was but twenty. With
all these achievements&mdash;splendid lad!&mdash;he fell
leading his platoon of Highlanders at Aubers
upon that most ill-fated, most tragic 9th of May.</p>

<p>“I always wanted my son to be just like
Keith”&mdash;more than one friend gave this tribute
to the stricken father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>Characteristic of the unchanged romantic
mysticism that lies deep in the hearts of the
Scots&mdash;Scots of the glens and hills&mdash;are the
words in which the local paper refers to the loss
which had befallen the country in the death of
the gallant young officer: “He died like a
Stewart: he dreed his weird, he drank the cup
of his race!”</p>

<p>It is the fine flower of our young manhood
that is being mown down. What is to become
of England, robbed of her best? It seems such
waste and loss; we who cannot fight feel at
times as if the pressure of such calamity “doth
make our very tears like unto bloode.” But we
must believe that it is not waste, but seed; that
the nations who sow in tears will reap in joy;
that each of these young lives, so gladly given,
shares in the redemption of the country; that, in
all reverence, in all faith, that they are mystically
united to Calvary; and that their glory
will be presently shown forth even as in the
glory of resurrection!</p>

<p>A correspondent writing from the front
describes the expression in the eyes of the
friendly officer, who has been his guide, as he
pointed out the myriad crosses of the burial-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>ground.
“He looked envious,” he says, and
adds that he noticed that all out there “speak
with envy of the dead.”</p>

<p>Is not the nation’s honour sharpened to its
finest point when the ideal of its manhood is to
die for the country? <i>Dulce et decorum....</i></p>

<p>We were very glad, nevertheless, when, in
spite of his repeated applications to return to
his own men, H. was ordered to take a command
in the Persian Gulf. The link that binds a man
to comrades with whom he has shared every
possible danger and hardship, to those who
have faced death with him, whom he has himself
led on to peril and agony, the while they
have been to him as his children&mdash;such a link
is indeed one that is hard to break! Their
peril has been his; their glory is his pride.</p>

<p>“If I can single out one regiment for special
praise,” said the Commander-in-Chief, “it is the
Worcesters.”</p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“I consider the Worcesters saved Europe on
that day.”</p>

<p>It is no wonder that H. should be proud of
them; that the thousand fibres should draw
him back to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>But, when the summons came, he was told
“to prepare for a hot climate.” And then, of all
strange things, or so it seemed to us, we found
that his destination was Persia. The Garden
of Eden! Further, it was rumoured, the
objective was likely to be Bagdad. It sounded
like a fairy tale. He promised us Attar of
Roses; and indeed, we think, carpets. And a
flippant niece wrote to him that she was sure
that by a little perseverance he could find a
magic one, and come sailing across the sky
some night after duty, like the merchant in the
Arabian nights. She added: “And do bring
me a hanging garden, if you can.” But when
the parting came it was a very cruel reality.
It’s a far cry to Persia!</p>

<p>He started on the day of the sinking of the
<i>Lusitania</i>; a date branded on the history of
the world till the end of all time. The two
who had gone to fetch him and brought him
home&mdash;so contented in their tender anxiety
that he was safely wounded&mdash;saw him on
board the great liner.</p>

<p>Many Indians returning to Bombay, a few
officers ordered to his own destination, a batch
of nurses for Malta, and one or two ladies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
hurrying to their sons wounded in the Dardanelles&mdash;these
were all his fellow-passengers.</p>

<p>It somewhat restored our confidence, shaken
by the facile success of the monstrous crime,
to know that they were to be convoyed a
certain way, and that they had a gun on
board. Nevertheless, they were not to escape
menace.</p>

<p>“The evening we started,” he wrote, “I
asked the steward if they had seen any submarines
about. ‘No, sir,’ he admitted reluctantly.
Then brightened up, anxious to oblige,
‘But we have seen a lot of luggage floating
about&mdash;trunks and clothes, sir.’”</p>

<p>(It was obvious no passenger need give up
hope; and, indeed, the letter posted at Gibraltar
continues):&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have had no occasion to use your lifesaving
waistcoat yet, though, as a matter of
fact, we <i>had</i> a small-sized adventure with a
submarine. At dinner on Monday we felt that
they had suddenly altered the ship’s course.
It appears that a submarine was spotted about
five hundred yards away. The captain slewed
the vessel round to bring our one gun to bear
on her. However, the smoke obscured our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>
view, and the submarine must have seen our
gun, as she disappeared.”</p>

<p>Then comes an anecdote, dreadfully characteristic
of our happy-go-lucky English ways, a
comedy that might have been&mdash;for this house,
at least, God knows!&mdash;the direst tragedy.</p>

<p>“Next day,” he continues, “we had gun
practice, but it turned out that none of the
gun’s crew knew how to work her; and after
fumbling for about two hours, a passenger
came along and showed them how to manage
her, and fired her off. We all cheered.”</p>

<p>The next stage on that lengthening journey
that is to take him so unrealizably far away
from us is Malta. The place laid its spell upon
him, though at first he writes:</p>

<p>“From the ship both islands looked most
unprepossessing: dry, arid, khaki-coloured
lumps, full of khaki-coloured buildings. Once
on shore one begins to love the place. The
buildings, fortifications, and general spirit are
most inspiring and grandiose. One expects to
see some proud old Templar riding down the
gay streets, looking neither to the right nor
left. I had no time to do any of the right
Cathedrals, where there are wonderful paint<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>ings
by Michael Angelo, etc., nor the Grand
Master’s Palace Armoury, with the knight’s
armour, nor the Inquisitor’s Palace. I went
off to look for wounded Worcesters from the
Dardanelles. I had no time to see anything
else as the hospital was a long way off.</p>

<p>“Every hole and corner is turned into a
beautiful garden, with lovely flowers and
‘penetrating scents,’ fountains, and shady
palms and trees.</p>

<p>“How you would revel in the churches!
They are more numerous than in Rome, and
quite beautiful. The people, too, are intensely
religious.</p>

<p>“There are many French shops here, and
the French women look tawdry beside the
Maltese, with their wonderful black cloaks and
reserved aristocratic air.</p>

<p>“I am sending you a weird map full of quaint
spelling, given to me by a wounded Worcestershire
(4th Batt.) sergeant, at the hospital at
Malta, and a rough idea of the difficulties of
the landing. Early on one Monday morning,
about 1 a.m., the ships got into position round
the promontory, with the troop lighters behind.
About 4 a.m. the latter were towed off during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
a bombardment such as never has been heard
or seen before in the history of the world.</p>

<p>“The Turks did not reply till the boats got
quite close to shore and the ships’ guns could
not fire on the located maxims (which were
sunk in deep, narrow slips close to the shore).
As far as I gathered, the Lancashire Fusiliers
were the first actually to get on shore on the
extreme left at Tekki Barna, where they
charged with the bayonet and the Turks
retired. They were able to enfilade a good
portion of the ground, and enabled the Essex
and 4th Worcesters, both of whom had suffered
very heavily from Maxim fire, to land and drive
the Turks back. Three boatloads of Dublin
Fusiliers were wiped out by gun and Maxim
fire near Ish Messarer point. The Lancashire
Fusiliers suffered rather badly from the fire of
some of our ships’ guns, which, of course, could
not be helped.</p>

<p>“The Worcesters were sent up to help the
Essex, and advanced against some barbed wire,
which a young subaltern called Wyse volunteered
to cut. He rolled over sideways till he
got under the wire and cut it from strand to
strand upwards. As he got to the last strand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
a sniper shot off two fingers in successive
shots.</p>

<p>“The snipers had their faces painted green
to harmonize with the surroundings, and were
calmly surrendering as we advanced, having
picked off numbers of men. They were all
shot, however, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>.</p>

<p>“My sergeant was shot in the hip that evening,
but he told me that by Wednesday the troops
had secured Envedos, a most important position,
and the safe landing of stores and guns was
thus secured.</p>

<p>“He said the Turks either ran from the
bayonet or surrendered. The prisoners said
they did not want to fight, but were forced to
do so by the Germans.</p>

<p>“The ships are in their more or less correct
position in the map, the sergeant says, as he
took trouble to find out from a naval chart.”</p>

<p>From Malta to Alexandria, from Alexandria
to Aden, and from thence to Bombay. His
letters mark each point of his Odyssey. And
at Alexandria he is fascinated with the movement
and colour; he goes on shore and visits
the shops; he parts from the delightful American
lady who has been the life and soul of the ship;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
she whose wounded son awaits her in Cairo.
At Aden, the heat striking at them from the
shore prevents him from landing; an unattractive
torrid spot. Here they take in a young
Indian Government official, who gives an interesting
detail upon his destination:</p>

<p>“He knew Wilcox very well, the man who
was going to make the barrage on the Euphrates
and Tigris, and convert Mesopotamia into the
richest country in the world. Wilcox said he
found all the details given in the Bible about
the various depths and breadths of the rivers
absolutely accurate&mdash;curious after all these
centuries!”</p>

<p>At Bombay he has a pleasant time; a brother
officer having wired to relations who take him
about and show him what is most worth
seeing in his short stay. He puts up at the
Bombay Yacht Club, “wonderful place, like
fairyland, with palms and fountains and music,
with cool, quiet rooms looking out over wide
and lovely views.” He goes on long drives
“under trees that grow for miles and miles
along the sea coast, where the graceful-moving
natives in their bright colours look awfully
picturesque.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>He sees the famous towers of silence where,
with effective, but no doubt quite unconscious,
alliteration, he describes “the ghoulish vultures
sitting grimly in the glorious gold mohur
trees.”</p>

<p>His last letter says: “I start on Sunday for
Bosra.”</p>

<p>He believes that they will remain at Bosra,
and makes little of the fact that the heat is
terrible there just now.</p>

<p>“We will live in cool underground rooms,”
he says, “and be all right!”</p>

<p>And now we know that we shall not have
news of him again for a long time. A thousand
anxieties assail us, for which we can have no
reassurance. We picture him in that strange
region, but realize that of its strangeness we
can form no real image.</p>

<p>He will see the dead cities and the great
desert wastes and the swamps&mdash;it is in those
swamps under the merciless sun that our terror
lies; he will deal with a fierce and treacherous
people whose thoughts are not as our thoughts,
whose motives and beliefs are irreconcilably
alien; and this dangerous race is fermenting
under the influences, the money, the lies, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
ceaseless open and secret poison leaven of
a race more treacherous, more dangerous
still.</p>

<p>Blinding sunshine, black shadows, arid
stretches of dried earth and mud and burnt
vegetation; the colour of the Eastern crowd,
the river waters and the harbour stretch; the
Arab and the Kurd, the Turk, the Armenian,
and the Jew, sights and scenes and creatures
that have been but as names to us, are about
him. He has followed the drum from Cape
Town to Magaliesburg, from Bloemfontein to
Bethlehem, from Gibraltar to Cork, from Soupir
to Ypres, from Ypres to Plymouth, and from
Plymouth to the Euphrates; he has left his
cool, green Ireland, his hunting and his fishing,
his own wide acres and the rural life among
his beasts for this picturesque, unknown, uncertain
destiny!</p>

<p>Often in the long hot hours will not his mind
go back to those stretches of shady, luxuriant
park land where his cattle feed; to the great
lime avenue with the voice of the bees; the
circle of the purple hills, the woods, those
incomparable woods of our old home with
their cool depths of bracken, silver green; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
dells, the climbing roads, the view over the
“deer-park” to the sunset, which impressed
even our childish imaginations; the voice of
the wild pigeons through the trees; and the
immense white house&mdash;empty&mdash;which before
this war broke out, he was about to furnish;
the corridors, the vast rooms full of memories;
latterly, to us, of hopes. His heart will be
there, we know.</p>

<p>And his home is guarded by his faithful
Spanish servant, who followed him, out of
love, from those far Gibraltar days of his
young soldier’s life; who, when a legacy made
of him a comparatively rich man, refused to
profit of it, and sent the money back to a distant
relative in Spain, saying: “What do I want of
it? You, my master, you, my father, you, my
mother, you, my country, you, all I want!”
Pedro, by a singular freak of fate, ruling this
Irish land with an equal zeal and ability, writes
to us: “I pray my dere master may come home
safe. I have great hope in Our Lady, the
Mother of God.”</p>

<p>What is left to us, too, but a similar trust?
We can but commend him to the Father of
All that He may overshadow him with His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
shoulders; that the sun should not burn him
by day, nor the moon by night; that he may
be guarded from the arrow that flieth by day,
from the assault of the evil one in the noontide!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="pfirst"><i><span class="smcap">June</span> 29, 1915.</i>&mdash;The feast of Peter and Paul
comes round with a new significance. In war
time we learn the meaning of so much that has
seemed unimportant; of things hidden away at
the back of our consciousness&mdash;things neglected,
unknown, or even despised&mdash;and we
learn, too, the worthlessness of so much that
has seemed paramount and necessary, desirable
and precious. War is a stern master. He
teaches above all the relative values; how to
weigh the greater against the less; how to
fling away with one superb gesture the whole
sum of human possessions for a single imperishable
prize.</p>

<p>“What doth it profit a man if he gain the
whole world and suffer the loss of his own
soul?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>He who spoke these words gently to a
handful of poor Jews now seems to cry them
with a voice of thunder from end to end of the
earth.</p>

<p>Thus, this, their festival day, brings the two
great champions of the Cross&mdash;and it is for
Christ and the Cross that every son of England
is fighting to-day&mdash;before our minds with a
singular vividness and nearness: Peter, type
of the natural man, untutored; sure of himself
and of his own good impulses, of the honest
purpose of his guileless heart; impetuous,
loving, weak, with all purely human weakness,
even to betrayal; and&mdash;divinely strengthened&mdash;Peter
the rock, Peter the fisherman who conquered
the world! Paul, the Patrician, the
apostle born out of due time, whose ardour
is all of the intellect, keen as a blade and burning
as a flame; the little man of Tarsus upon
whose spirit the teaching of all Christianity
reposes as firmly to-day as does the Church
upon the stone of Peter; Paul, whom the
Captain, Christ Himself, enlisted by the
miraculous condescension of a personal appeal.
Has not every Christian, whatever his creed,
vowed them reverence throughout all the ages?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
To-day, may not the eyes of the believer look
up to them with a new confidence?</p>

<p>The Signora, lying through a wakeful night
and thinking of these things, went with a rush
of memory back to Rome, to scenes and experiences
and thoughts dominated by the
memories of the two chief apostles.</p>

<p>There is nothing more characteristic of their
lives than the different manners of their death.
Peter is Peter to the end; first yielding to the
natural impulse, then, by virtue of the grace
of God, returning upon himself and leaping to
the highest altitude of superhuman sacrifice.
In the whole tradition of the Church there is
no legend more touching than that which tells
us how Peter, flying out of Rome, met the
Christ carrying the Cross. It is the original
Peter in all his guilelessness who, unstartled
by the vision, with the perfect simplicity of his
faith, asks: “<i>Domine quo vadis?</i>” And it is
the sublime founder of the Church of God who,
unquestioning, accepts the Master’s rebuke,
and retraces his steps to face his Lord’s torment
with the added agony his own holy humility
demands.</p>

<p>Every pilgrim to Rome has knelt or stood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
prayed or pondered at the tomb of Peter in
the golden twilight of the great Basilica, by
the vastness of which, as Marion Crawford
says, “mind and judgment are dazed and
staggered.” Who has not leant on the marble
balustrade of the confession and looked down
upon the ninety-five gilded lamps that burn
there day and night, upon the kneeling white
figure of the Seventh Pius?&mdash;a vision in which
the whole linked grandeur and piety of the
Church of Rome seems epitomized. In St.
Peter’s, Simon, the poor fisherman, is little
thought of; it is Peter, saint and pontiff, who
is paramount; he who has miraculously fed
the lambs and fed the sheep from that hour on
the sea of Galilee to this day. And very few
remember the old man, too weak and aged to
bear his cross, who had climbed half-way to
the Janiculum, when his executioners, seeing
that he could not advance any further, planted
his gibbet in the deep yellow sand and crucified
him then and there&mdash;head downwards, as he
begged them. This is the ancient tradition,
and it further tells us that he was followed
by but few of the faithful, who stood apart,
weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>Impressive as are these hallowed spots,
these glorious memorials of the Eternal City;
however full, to the believer, of the atmosphere
of the days of faith&mdash;oases in the great desert
of life, where the palms of the martyrs are still
green and throw a grateful shade&mdash;there is
nothing, to our minds, in all the grandeur of
Rome, even under the dome of Peter, comparable
to the effect produced upon the mind
by a visit to Tre Fontane.</p>

<p>As Peter was led to die the death of the
lowest criminal&mdash;the death of his Master&mdash;Paul
was brought forth to the death of the sword,
reserved for the Patrician.</p>

<p>To go to Tre Fontane and visit the spot of
his martyrdom is to return to the primitive
ages of the Church. The fisherman lies in
a tomb such as no king or emperor, no hero
or conqueror or best beloved of the world’s
potentates ever had. And Paul sleeps in that
great pillared church <i>fuori le mura</i>, in a severity
and dignity of magnificence very well befitting
the stern fire of the apostle’s zeal. But the
memory of his martyrdom is consecrated in
a curious isolation of poverty, one might almost
say, aloofness; an earnest purity that reminds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
one, as we have said, of early Christian times.
You have all the splendours; the golden glory,
the marble, the mosaic, the sculpture and the
jewels; the movement, the colour and the crowd
of Rome behind, and you come out into the
sweeping solitudes of the Campagna. For
those who know and love those strange, arid,
melancholy spaces, there is no more potent
spell than the hold they lay upon the spirit.
The gem-like distances of the mountains, the
radiant arch of the Italian sky, the movement
of light and shadow over the immense waste,
the romance of each of the historic ways, the
mystery of the secrets they hold&mdash;better pens
than ours have striven to embody the charm
and failed! Why should we try? It is like
a strain of music the meaning of which is lost
to us. We hear; we cannot understand. It is
too full of messages. It is sad and beautiful
and haunting, and withal intensely human.
Here you have nature at her wildest and most
untrammelled; and yet, never was city so
peopled, so thick with memories of all races
and all histories; endless streams of pilgrims
have traversed the long roads; the centuries
have come and gone upon them; the blood,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
the tears, the strivings and hopes of all humanity
are here.</p>

<p>One looks forward towards wave upon wave
of low-lying ground, bordered by the mountain
barriers; and each time one looks back, the
dome of Peter hangs pearl-like against the
sky.</p>

<p>Speaking of the memory of our drive to Tre
Fontane, the Signorina is reminded that she
has jotted down her impressions in an old
diary.</p>

<p>“We drove to the Trappist Monastery,” she
wrote, “where St. Paul was beheaded. His
head is said to have rebounded three times as
it struck the earth, and on each of those three
hallowed spots there sprang up a miraculous
jet of water. The first spring is still warm as
if with the glow of the great spirit that there
left its mortal frame; the second spring is
tepid; the third cold as death.</p>

<p>“The drive is a beautiful one; through the
Campagna stretching wide and green on either
side, bounded by the mountains, some now
snow-capped. The first sight of the monastery
breaks on one from the top of a little hill. The
huddled buildings appear suddenly at the foot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
in a deep valley, shrouded by eucalyptus
groves. On the right of the convent the
ground rises again, covered with a perfect
forest of the same trees. It is one of the
saddest and most impressive places I ever
saw. It strikes chill, even when the rest of
the Campagna is warm, and the continual
shuddering of the eucalyptus leaves makes
an uncanny murmur. We drove through an
avenue of them, grey-green all over, trunks
and leaves; and then came to an arched gateway
closed by an iron gate.</p>

<p>“We dismounted from our carriage, already
quite impressed, and pulled the bell, which
echoed with a deep and beautiful note through
the monastery grounds.</p>

<p>“A porter opened and we walked into the
garden, still under the eucalyptus (mingled
here with palms and lemons), and made more
beautiful still by the fragments of antique
sculpture that border the walks&mdash;marble
capitols and broken acanthus leaves and
pieces of old pavements wonderfully worked
in scrolls and twists.</p>

<p>“Papa particularly lost his heart to a lion’s
head, with a dear flat nose! He could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
tear himself away from it; he wanted it so
badly for our new little garden in Surrey!</p>

<p>“As there are three fountains, so there are
three churches, but the miraculous springs are
all under one roof. This is a fine, comparatively
modern church, situated at the end of an
avenue of eucalyptus and marble fragments.
It has a classic pavement (pagan) representing
the four seasons.</p>

<p>“Opposite the entrance are the fountains&mdash;built
in, now, and covered over, but each with
a little opening where the attendant friar will
let down a ladle and draw up the water for the
faithful. Over each fountain is an altar, with
the head of St. Paul, in bas-relief, sculptured
by Canova:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“‘A la première, l’âme vient à l’instant même
de s’échapper du corps. Ce chef glorieux est
plein de vie! A la seconde, les ombres de la
mort couvrent déjà ses admirables traits; à la
troisième, le sommeil éternel les a envahis, et
quoique demeurés tout rayonnants de beauté,
ils disent, sans parler, que dans ce monde ces
lèvres ne s’entr’ouvriront plus, et que ce regard
d’aigle s’est voilé pour toujours.’</p></blockquote>

<p>“In the right-hand corner of the first altar is
the pillar which marks the actual spot of the
martyrdom of the fiery-hearted saint. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
ancient Via Lorentina passed along this very
place, and here stood the mile-stone, whereat
St. Paul was beheaded.</p>

<p>“‘This is absolutely certain,’ said the monk
who conducted us. ‘Even protestants acknowledge
the death to have taken place here. For
the rest,’ indicating the three fountains, ‘there
is only the legend. You may believe it or not,
as you like.’</p>

<p>“He looked so happy, this monk. He had
been thirty years at Tre Fontane, but there
was no sign of age on his face. It was, perhaps,
a trifle withered, like a ripe apple that
has lain long on a shelf, but that was all. And
yet he said that, for the first fifteen years, he
had suffered continuously from malarial fever.
He had superintended, and even worked at, the
planting of the eucalyptus groves which have
so purified the district that there has not been
one case of the sickness since.</p>

<p>“The other two churches are close to one
another. The first is very old and utterly bare,
and, in a strange, mournful way, deeply impressive.
It dates from the sixth century, and
is lofty and vaulted and almost Gothic in its
spirit. It has several rose-windows, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
are many round holes in the walls also. These
are now either empty or fitted with common
glass, but they were once filled with thin slices
of alabaster, or other precious transparencies.
At present it seems the embodiment in stone
of the Trappist order, ‘la piu severa ordine
della chiesa Cattolica,’ as our monk described
it. The church is as cold as a well.</p>

<p>“The last of the three churches is of a much
gayer mood: quite Romanesque, perched on a
pretty flight of rounded steps. It has a crypt
over the bodies of St. Zeno and two thousand
and more companions, martyred Christians,
who built the Baths of Diocletian.”</p>

<p>The drive through that eucalyptus wood
here described remains one of the most curious
impressions of those Roman days. It was like
passing through a Dante circle&mdash;the first circle
of all, of Limbo, where Virgil met the poet; an
unsubstantial wraith-like world, full of a perpetual
whisper and murmur:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Quivi, secondo che per ascoltare,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Non avea pianto, ma che di sospiri,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Che l’aura eterna facevan tremare:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">E cio avvenia di duol senza martiri,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ch’avean le turbe, ch’eran molte e grandi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">E d’infanti, e di femmine e di vivi.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Whether the sky became really overcast as we
entered into these mysterious precincts, or
whether the height of the trees shadowed the
narrow way, certainly there was a dimness
about us; not a positive darkness but a negation
of light, even as the chill that enfolded us
was not so much a cold as a cessation of heat.</p>

<p>But through the gates of the monastery
courtyard we saw sunshine again, and white
pigeons strutting about the cobbles, picking
and preening themselves&mdash;a wonderful picture
of peace. It is a consecrated spot; a place the
most aloof, the most severe, the most denuded
of all earthly joys that we have ever seen; a
stage on the arid way of pilgrims forging determinedly
by the shortest cut to heaven. And
yet it is full of sweetness. As from a mountain
ledge, the world must lie so far below these
Trappists that it is no longer seen, scarcely
divined behind its own vapours. No use looking
down: looking up&mdash;there is the blue sky, and
there are the peaks pointing heavenward, still
to be conquered. There is very little comfort
for the traveller, but he has a strange gladness.
He is cradled in ethereal silences. The balm
of majestic solitude bathes his soul; his spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
is cheered by an air as pure as it is vivifying,
and he knows that he will climb the peaks.</p>

<p><i>July 4.</i>&mdash;Mrs. McComfort, our cook, has a
brother on the Clyde. He writes an extraordinary
account of the effort expected of, and
given by, the able workman.</p>

<p>“It may be, miss,” says Mrs. McComfort to
the Signorina, her chief confidant, “he’ll be
called up for a job on a ship that’s just come in,
and that’ll mean that he and the rest of them
will be at it from seven in the morning till eight
the next morning. Yes, miss, all night, as well
as all day. And then they’ll come home, and
it’s too weary to eat they are, and they’ll just
roll themselves up and fall asleep, as tired as
dogs; and when they’ve slept a bit, maybe
they can get a little food down. And then it’s
off back again to work! And that’ll go on till
the job’s done. And when the battleships
come in, the steamers do be waiting all night
upon the Clyde, to take the men up to them,
it’s that urgent. And, oh, miss, how they do
love the ships they’ve built! And when one is
lost, you’d never believe the grief there is, with
the men crying and saying: ‘It’s my old lady’s
gone, my poor old lady!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>They need no comment, such stories as these.
Here are humble heroes, martyrs of duty; here
is the poor heart of humanity, with its infinite
power of attachment. We have scarcely heard
of anything more touching than the tears of
these rough men for their “poor old lady.”</p>

<p>We saw a letter the other day from a transport
driver describing, to a relative in England,
the meeting with an old friend on the bloodstained,
shell-battered road at the back of
Arras. This man had been the driver of
a motor omnibus in a country district at
home.</p>

<p>“What do you think?” he writes. “You’ll
never believe! If I didn’t come across old
Eliza! Me that drove her for more than three
years. I knew her at once, poor old girl!
knocked about as she was; I’d have known her
anywhere, by the shape of her, knowing her in
and out as I did those years, every bit of her.
She was a bit the worse for wear, but she was
fit for a lot yet; a trifle rattley; but there’s a
deal of life in her. I can’t tell you what I felt
when I came across her so sudden. There, I
couldn’t help patting her and patting her!
Poor old Eliza! To think of her and me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
meeting again like that, both of us doing our
bit, like!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This fourth day of July brings us the third
of the rain and thunder squalls which have
followed the great drought.</p>

<p>Japhet says, relaxing to something approaching
a smile, that he doesn’t see why this
should not end by being a nice garden, and
that the earth is in very good heart.</p>

<p>Dear English earth, it has need to be in good
heart! Who knows what it may yet have to
bear and give?</p>

<p>The Villino garden wears the war-time
stamp, at least to its owners’ eye! The
Signora, who has always hitherto plunged at
a horticultural list the moment there was a gap
in her borders that needed filling or a mistake
that needed repairing, which could not be done
to her sense of perfection “out of stock,” has
had to teach economy to wait on necessity,
and ingenuity on both. The result is not
really gratifying. In all her long experience
economy has never been gratifying in any
branch of life. But even if the money were
there for extravagance&mdash;which it isn’t&mdash;thrift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
has become a positive instead of a negative
virtue.</p>

<p>“Thou shalt not spend” is now nearly as
urgent a commandment as “Thou shalt not
steal.”</p>

<p>It has set her mind to work more and more,
however, upon the desirability of permanence
in the garden.</p>

<p>In the borders of the terraces round the
house she has decided to put a foot-deep
edging of Mrs. Simkins pinks. These are
adorable in their time of bloom, and the grey-green
foliage is tidy, and a pretty bit of colour
all the year round.</p>

<p>This year the lobelia, scantily planted, and
the climbing geraniums, pathetically subdivided,
will take considerable time before
forming the show of flower and foliage without
which the Villino garden is a failure. But it is
a very good thing for individuals as well as
nations to be forced to stop and examine their
manner of life. Hideous as the struggle is&mdash;dead
loss of life and happiness and money&mdash;good
comes out of the evil at many points. Not the
least beneficial lesson is that which teaches us
now what an extraordinary amount of money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>
and energy one has frittered away by easy-going
ways, the amount of items one can put
down in a household without being the worse&mdash;rather,
indeed, the better! Even in a little
household, what waste, what excess, what
follies of mere show! And if this seems a flat
contradiction to the remark upon economy
passed a little while ago, let it be noted that
conscience and inclination are for ever waging
war, and that conscience, as is proper, must
have the last word. Moreover, once the domination
of conscience is established, the results are,
in nine cases out of ten, surprisingly bearable.
Frugality combines very well with refinement,
and simplicity with dignity. One can be as happy
with a three-course lunch and a three-course
supper-dinner as one was with an endless
array of dishes&mdash;those dishes which took so
much time and material to prepare, and were
so often barely touched! The contents disappeared&mdash;thrown
away, perhaps, or, what was
certainly the case in our household, disposed
of as <i>hors d’œuvres</i> between the dining-room
and the pantry.</p>

<p>“Why does your butler always come in
chewing?” asked an observant relative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>Juvenal, indeed, despite a certain foreign
disregard for his meal-times, made such a practice
of snatching morsels in transit that the
sixteen-year old footman&mdash;chief of the many
grievances which determined our separation&mdash;who
outstayed him, has had to be severely
reprimanded for making a clean sweep of the
dishes that caught his young fancy, with a
special partiality for roast chicken.</p>

<p>The new regimen&mdash;agreeable this hot weather&mdash;of
soup, one cold-meat dish, salad, vegetable,
sweet, and dessert&mdash;supper, in fact, instead of
dinner&mdash;has, besides its intrinsic economy, the
further advantage of diminishing the expenditure
of kitchen coal to an almost incredible
degree.</p>

<p>We who have to render an account hereafter,
even of every idle word, shall we have to
answer, we wonder, for all that unconscious
waste which mere convention has induced in
our homes? How many poor families might
have been fed from the agglomeration of the
Signora’s years of housekeeping! She did not
think. No one thought. It has taken this
scourge to make us stop in our easy course,
to make us look into ourselves, into our ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“What can we do? What can we do without?”
These must be now the mottoes written
large round our house of life; and, indeed, the
first includes the second, for it takes considerable
energy to abstain.</p>

<p>“There is none that thinketh in his heart,
therefore they shall go down alive into hell.”</p>

<p>A very disagreeable text, which comes disagreeably
to the mind this Sunday morning,
for the <i>famiglia</i> have just come back from
church, where what is vulgarly called a “hell-fire
sermon” was delivered by a Welsh
preacher, who, though a Franciscan, is, one
of his congregation declared, a revivalist lost
to his native hills.</p>

<p>“You ought to go down into hell in spirit
every day, me brethren,” he thundered, “or
ye’ll very likely find yourselves there in the end.
And what an off-ful thing that ’ud be! And
there’s thousands and thousands of soa-ouls
there this minute, better than you are!”</p>

<p>This was neither comforting, nor, we believe,
theological, for the congregation was small,
and, on the whole, devout. But no doubt
there is a type of mind before which it is necessary
to hold up a threat of everlasting punish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>ment;
the type of person whom conscription
alone can move to serve his country before it is
too late.</p>

<p>Not the least remarkable result of the German
brutality is that the great majority of its opponents
find themselves forced back into the
old simplicity of belief. We can no longer
afford to deny the existence of demons and
their power; and if reason is to keep her
balance and the soul her ultimate faith in Divine
justice, acceptance of the doctrine of hell and
adequate punishment must logically follow.</p>

<p>A celebrated, if rather medievally minded,
preacher, whom we once heard lashing the
vices of the day, cried sarcastically: “You’ll
meet the very best society in hell.”</p>

<p>Holy man, we doubt if he would have made
the same remark to-day! The resort in question
must have become so overwhelmingly
German.</p>

<p><i>July 8.</i>&mdash;The Signora had been a whole year
at the Villino&mdash;perhaps the longest time in all
her life in one place&mdash;but circumstances had
summoned her family to London for a few
days, and she could not contemplate their being
exposed to Zeppelins without her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>The little London house which was our home
so long, and&mdash;to use nursery parlance&mdash;the
nose of which has been so completely put out
of joint by the Villino, seemed glad to see
us again.</p>

<p>How curious is the atmosphere of place!
These walls that enfold us, that have seen our
swift joys and our great sorrows, our merry
hours and our sad ones, become fond of us, as
we of them. We are convinced that there is
a spirit in inanimate things, something that
gives back, that keeps. Do not old places
ponder? Are they not set with memories?
Do they not know their own? Do they not
withhold themselves and suffer from the
stranger? Who has not seen the millionaire
striving to make himself at home in the great
house that will have none of him? Who has
not felt what an accident he is, how little he
belongs, how little he or his race will ever
belong to the stones he has bought, and which
he will never own?</p>

<p>And even a little London house in a street
may become individual to oneself; and you
may feel as the Signora did, that it has missed
you, that through long absence you have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
unkind; that if you finally separate yourself
from it, it will always want you, and you it.
And, after all&mdash;it is with houses, as with
people&mdash;the link is not necessarily that of the
blood relationship or long acquaintance. You
need not have inherited your affinity. You are
in sympathy, or you are not. The Villino
claimed us upon our first meeting, but we
impressed ourselves upon the town dwelling.
It is still home to us; not <i>the</i> home, <i>a</i> home.</p>

<p>We sat in the high-ceilinged drawing-room,
with its rather delicate Georgian air, and found
old familiar emotions waiting for us. And we
thought of all the kind and dear friends we had
seen between these walls; of our gay little
parties and the music-makers who had made
music to us; hours that seemed to belong to
another life. Here the great Pole, whose magic
hands have refused themselves to the notes ever
since his people have been in anguish, made
the night wonderful with his incomparable art.
We do not think the small London house can
ever forget the echoes of that music. It was
always a feast for it when he, with whose
friendship we feel ourselves so deeply honoured,
came to its board. Loki&mdash;he was in his puppy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>hood
then&mdash;decorated with the Polish colours,
would dance towards him on his hind-legs.
The genius would come in like sunshine, happy
himself in the immense pleasure his presence
gave. Certainly this rare being seemed to give
forth light.</p>

<p>“When he leaves the room,” said a friend of
his to us, “it is as if the light went out.”</p>

<p>If one had the gift of beholding auras, what a
halo of fire would one not have seen about that
wonderful head? We once said this to him.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in it?” we asked.</p>

<p>He smiled. “I think everyone has got his
flame to cultivate. I think I have cultivated
mine.”</p>

<p>Most truly, indeed, has he done so; and not
only in the divine way of his art, for year by
year the selflessness and the magnanimity of
his character seem to deepen and extend; and
so, too&mdash;inevitable tragedy of years&mdash;the sadness.
Impossible for any perfectly noble mind
not to gather melancholy as life goes on!&mdash;a
melancholy culminating in his case with the
burthen of agony which the present sufferings
of his own race have laid upon his shoulders.</p>

<p>Therefore these memories of the days when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
he was as a young god, the days when a celebrated
painter could find no truer way of expressing
him than by flinging on the canvas
the radiant vision of an Apollo, are poignant
memories. We are glad that we should have
them, yet they bring a stab of pain for that lost
high spirit which life inevitably dashes.</p>

<p>With us all, the good ship Youth sets forth
merrily with sails taut and pennons fluttering,
filling to the wind and breasting the waves!
We know that inevitably the storm winds must
catch her; that she will be beaten by breakers;
drawn out of her course by false currents; that
if she become not a derelict, if she does not
founder with all hands, she must&mdash;too often&mdash;cast
much of her treasure overboard, furl her
white wings, and come creeping into a cold
harbour. Even those who, like our rare and
wonderful friend, have gathered glory and
dignity and power, as they plough a mighty
course, have passed from under radiant skies
into the gloom of the storm. A sombre thing,
the human span, at the best, and most blest
nowadays.</p>

<p>What can we say of the fair craft that founders
almost as soon as launched? Ah! the young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
ghosts in that London drawing-room! The
sound of the children’s voices yet ringing in
our ears! There is “Mustard-Seed,” the
splendid little fair boy, who had been the
favourite of our Shakesperian revels nine years
ago&mdash;not yet nineteen, not a month a soldier&mdash;shot
through the head on that Flanders field,
the graveyard of England’s choicest! And the
little Scotch lad, who used to prance about in
his black velvet suit, with cheeks that shamed
the apple&mdash;no one knows where he lies to-day;
only two or three saw him fall. And his graver,
gentler brother&mdash;a prisoner, even as we write
in the first agony of the grief which has
befallen him in the loss of his life-companion!</p>

<p>And out of a merry group of Irish children,
irresponsible, high-spirited, noisy, two brothers
sleep in that alien earth&mdash;now for ever English&mdash;“where
their young dust lies,” as the poet
who wrote so prophetically of his own fate has
beautifully said. And yet another is wounded,
and another invalided; and the once merry
sister, whose gallant husband was left wounded
on the field and was missing long weeks, still
mourns him as a prisoner.</p>

<p>Of the rest of the company, those companions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
of our daughter’s own unclouded childish days,
some are widows; and some can scarce meet
the morning for apprehension of its news, or
return to their homes for fear of that orange
envelope that may lie on the hall table, or sleep
in the night for listening for the sound of the
bell. And some are in the Dardanelles, under
skies of brass, treading on earth of iron, and
some are in those trenches, deep-dyed and
battered a hundredfold. Two more brothers&mdash;the
elder twenty and the younger nineteen&mdash;fell
within a month of each other. A few are
still on English soil, light-heartedly preparing
for the great fray, straining like hounds at
the leash, staring with bright, impatient eyes
towards that goal with its unknown and terrible
possibilities; cursing the slow flight of time.
Of these one thinks, perhaps, with a heart more
tightened than of all the rest!</p>

<p>The reaper has come forth to reap out of
season, and the young corn is mown down in
the green ear, and all the poppies and the
pretty flowers go down with it.</p>

<p>Sitting in rooms which we had not revisited
since before the war, these are sad thoughts
that the crowded recollections bring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>London itself, however, seemed little changed;
even that much-discussed night-darkness
hardly noticeable. Driving in the daytime we
instinctively counted, with frowning glance,
the number of stalwart young men out of
uniform, and wondered how any girl could
walk with them, much less smile upon them.
And our eyes followed the soldiers with pride
as they marched by, singing popular catches
to inspire themselves in default of the band
which the stern necessities of this war forbid.
What fine fellows they are&mdash;so well set up,
looking out with such steady vision upon the
future which they have chosen! And the lilt
of the merry tune, with what a deep note of
pathos it strikes upon the ear!</p>

<p>Of course there are a great many soldiers
about London, yet no more than in Jubilee
time, and there is no greater excitement among
them, and a good deal less among those who
watch them pass, than in the days when it was
all pomp and circumstance, and no warfare.</p>

<p>London does not carry the stamp of war
about her, but we carry it each one of us in our
hearts. That is why we sicken from the music-hall
posters; why wrath and grief mingle in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
our minds at the sight of that bold-eyed community
with its whitened face, its vulgar exaggeration
of attire, and its unchecked and
unashamed hunting of its prey; a prey sometimes
visibly unwilling, sometimes pathetically,
innocently flattered!</p>

<p>The Zeppelin menace has created no sense
of apprehension in the town. The first night
of our arrival we conscientiously prepared
amateur respirators for ourselves and such
of the <i>famiglia</i> as accompanied us. Pads of
cotton-wool, soaked in a strong solution of
soda, were placed within easy reach of the bedside.
The next night we said “Bother!” and
the third night we forgot all about it. Though
the Signora, lying awake, had occasionally a
half-amused speculation whether the throbbing
passage of some more than usually loud traction-engine,
or the distant back-firing of a
belated taxicab, might not be the bark of the
real wolf at last!</p>

<p>Our little white-haired housemaid, generally
left alone to mind the London house, possesses
this philosophic indifference. She made herself
a respirator. We doubt whether she ever
thinks of placing it handy. We believe she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
shares the view of the old nurse of a friend of
ours into whose garden a bomb really and truly
did drop during the recent raid on Southend.</p>

<p>“Frightened, miss? Lord bless you, no! I
knew it was only them Germans!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though London is neither
alarmed nor depressed, we set our faces towards
the Villino again with a sense of relief.
These days it is better to be in one’s own
place; and in London we feel only visitors
now. Yet, strangely, the country is far more
full of the war than the town.</p>

<p>Beginning at Wimbledon, we meet motorcars
filled to overflowing with bandaged, bronze-faced
young men, who smile and wave their
hands as we whizz by. Dear lads! Some
from that greater England beyond the sea,
more closely our brothers now than ever
before, with ties cemented by the shedding of
blood. <i>Blut-Bruderschaft</i>, indeed, you have
pledged with us: a Teutonic rite put into
practice after a fashion our enemies thought
out of the range of possibility.</p>

<p>And presently we come to the camps. Here,
where the pine-woods solitary marched, where
the heather was wont to spread, crimsoning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>
and purpling to the line of blue distance&mdash;a
wonderful vision of wild scenery&mdash;here is a
brown waste, peopled with a new town. Rows
and rows of wooden huts run in parallel lines.
Where the trees stood you cannot even guess;
but once and again there is the smell of the
raw wood, and you see a giant lying lopped of
his branches. And the whole place swarms in
activity. We pass hundreds of ammunition and
gun carriages&mdash;the two-wheeled carts for the
new howitzers&mdash;some already with the guns in
place; long sheds where half a dozen smiths
are busy shoeing, with groups of patient horses,
shoulder by shoulder, waiting outside; we hear
the clank of iron upon iron from within; we
catch the vision of red fire upon the sleek flank
and the brawny arms wielding the hammer.
Horses everywhere, it seems&mdash;lines of them,
picketed; horsemen coming and going: detachments
riding up and down among the
thickest dust that you have ever imagined;
and waggons lumbering, some charged with
fodder, some, as we pass, with loaves fresh
from the baking. And now a traction-engine,
filling the air with noise and smoke, driven by
two grimy Tommies who shout at each other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
as they throb and bumble along, has to be
dodged and left behind.</p>

<p>This is an artillery camp&mdash;a marvellous place
which gives one a more vivid impression of
England’s strength, of England’s new army,
than any words can describe. These splendid,
happy, vigorous, busy men; these rows of
howitzer and ammunition carts; these thousands
of sleek, lively horses; this untiring, determined
movement of work and preparation ... all for
the Dardanelles, we hear.</p>

<p>We get out of the dust and the noise and the
gigantic stir, and along the green roads again;
and then into another camp. A curious stillness
here: the myriad huts are all shut up, the
sheds empty, even the new shops seemingly
untenanted; only here and there stands a stray
khaki figure to emphasize the loneliness. They
left for the front the day before yesterday.
To-morrow twenty thousand new men are
expected, like a new swarm of bees, to take
their place in the vacated hives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Home again in the Villino, with all the fur
babies washed and waiting for us. Rather a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
silent group of dogs, a little offended because
we went away. Loki, who generally screams
with rapture, has certainly a reservation in the
ecstasy of his greetings; but Mimosa clings to
us with two little paws, like a child hugging a
recovered treasure, and offers kisses, of which
she is not generally prodigal. Plain Eliza is
shy. She has grown perceptibly in three days.</p>

<p>The garden is full of sweet scents. The
dawn, the coronation, and the crimson ramblers
are bursting into lovely bloom beside the blue
of the delphiniums.</p>

<p>There was always a special kind of joy in
the old days about home-coming to the Villino.
We used to go from room to room, taking stock
of the dear, queer little place; greeting the
serene, smiling Madonnas; the aloof angels
folded into their prayers; pagan, pondering
Polyhymnia in her corner of the drawing-room,
brooding upon the glory of times that will
never be again.... It is all just as it used
to be: bowery, without and within, as usual.</p>

<p>Everything is scrubbed to the last point of
daisy freshness and polished to spicy gloss
against the Padrona’s return, and smiling
damsels await compliments on the stairs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
Other years, as we say, these were moments
of unalloyed light-heartedness. It was always
unexpectedly nicer than we had imagined.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it dearer than ever?” we would say,
then, to each other. “Don’t you love it?
Aren’t we happy here?”</p>

<p>This year it is another cry that rises to our
lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, how happy we might be, if only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
